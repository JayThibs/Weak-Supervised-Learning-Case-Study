This may be achieved by including details of at least one of the following:\\n\\n1. - club achievements in particular competing in the higher levels of the Swedish football league system (Division 3 and above 1987 onwards / Division 4 and above pre 1987); \\n2. - a notable player(s) who has played for the club;\\n3. - widening the description of the club to include details of other sections of the club (some of whom may have made a notable contribution to their sport);\\n4. - significant club infrastructure that has been provided or is managed by the club such as an indoor sports hall and all weather pitches;\\n5. - special contribution to the local community such as clubs serving the needs of ethnic communities;\\n6. - unique features such as an island location or historic stadium.\\n\\nFailure to meet notability criteria could result in your page being recommended for deletion.\\n\\n  (Finnish Gas )</td>\n",

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am an aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol-Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I am a registered transport consultant at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free.

I ask that you bear with me on this.\\n\\nHistory\\nFrom alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.\\nMy work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. \\n\\nI returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to \"\"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account\"\". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for \"\"trolling and harassment\"\". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.\\n\\nI returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, \"\"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?\"\" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.\\n\\nDeclarations\\nI pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.\\nI promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.\\nI promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:\\nBode Miller\\nJulia Mancuso\\nShaun White\\nTed Ligety\\nPurna\\nAkola city\\n2010 Winter Olympics\\nAnd many more. . .\\nI issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.\\nTo Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you \"\"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock\"\". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?\\nI will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.\\nI hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.\\nI hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark</td>\n",

No  because Wikipedia utilizes editorial scrutiny when an article is tainted with undocumented allegations and inappropriate personal sentiment.

As long as the public record is noted with specific references, the strengths of the article should outweigh its disadvantages.\\n\\nApart from Raymond's unquestionable level within her profession, as evidenced by her non-PR work with Sony, et al., one of the main reasons to allow the entry is to chronicle the extraordinary and documented pitch of sexual harassment that was directed against her on the internet and within the gaming community once she became a spokesperson for Ubisoft. Hers has been a unique situation, and sexual harassment is an important issue because of her status as a pioneering woman in the gaming field.\\n\\nNo need to \"\"put the brakes\"\" on an article in which the achievements of the subject warrant a sober entry, and even the worst aspects of the controversy have lasting cultural resonance.

I did post once when I saw you closed an AfD as delete when they only comments were in favor of keeping, but then I remembered who you were and removed my comment. Another editor took your inappropriate action to DRV where it was overturned. So again, yes, you are rude, yes, you are involved, yes you are a bad admin, yes you are a consistenet policy violator, yes you are a hypocrite who asks an editor to steer clear but has no problem going after that same editor at your first opportunity, but nevermind.

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am an aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol-Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I am a registered transport consultant at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free.

I ask that you bear with me on this.\\n\\nHistory\\nFrom alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.\\nMy work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. \\n\\nI returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to \"\"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account\"\". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for \"\"trolling and harassment\"\". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.\\n\\nI returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, \"\"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?\"\" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.\\n\\nDeclarations\\nI pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.\\nI promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.\\nI promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:\\nBode Miller\\nJulia Mancuso\\nShaun White\\nTed Ligety\\nPurna\\nAkola city\\n2010 Winter Olympics\\nAnd many more. . .\\nI issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.\\nTo Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you \"\"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock\"\". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?\\nI will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.\\nI hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.\\nI hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark</td>\n",

No  because Wikipedia utilizes editorial scrutiny when an article is tainted with undocumented allegations and inappropriate personal sentiment.

As long as the public record is noted with specific references, the strengths of the article should outweigh its disadvantages.\\n\\nApart from Raymond's unquestionable level within her profession, as evidenced by her non-PR work with Sony, et al., one of the main reasons to allow the entry is to chronicle the extraordinary and documented pitch of sexual harassment that was directed against her on the internet and within the gaming community once she became a spokesperson for Ubisoft. Hers has been a unique situation, and sexual harassment is an important issue because of her status as a pioneering woman in the gaming field.\\n\\nNo need to \"\"put the brakes\"\" on an article in which the achievements of the subject warrant a sober entry, and even the worst aspects of the controversy have lasting cultural resonance.

Unless I am mistaken it ended with you requesting I not post on your talkpage. Unlike the worms and trolls emerging here on my page, I had no problem complying. I don't like hanging around creeps. I did post once when I saw you closed an AfD as delete when they only comments were in favor of keeping, but then I remembered who you were and removed my comment. Another editor took your inappropriate action to DRV where it was overturned. So again, yes, you are rude, yes, you are involved, yes you are a bad admin, yes you are a consistenet policy violator, yes you are a hypocrite who asks an editor to steer clear but has no problem going after that same editor at your first opportunity, but nevermind.

This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.\\n\\nSecondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am getting fed up of wikipedia. I am getting fed up of how admins just pounce on you if you are a newbie. I am seriously thinking of trolling and vandalising again. Good day</td>\n",
