First thing: all scientific information (i.e. somewhat accurate info...) should be publically verifyable, where verifyable means that one can check whatever is claimed, and public refers to the fact that anyone can do that. Now, if you cite some source, like in the example above, it says \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number). Unlike what you might think, that does not mean that the sentence \"\"blah blah near daily\"\" is a universally accepted fact  as proven by the fact that you have another opinion. What the phrase \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number) actually means is \"\"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah near daily\"\", which, you'll agree, is fully correct. After all, that is what's written there and anyone can look at the source (because it's public) and read what is says (verifyable). Now, if you think that blah blah occured daily an not near daily, that is fine. But how should you go about it ? One thing you can not do: change the sentence and leave the citation! Because then it would mean: \"\"in (citation number), someone claims blah blah daily\"\". That is not true! If you look at the source, you'll see it says \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"! Which is just what Nil Einne pointed out. Of course it can happen that what's written in the source is not accurate. But that doesn't mean you have the right to change it as you did.\\nWhat you can do is add another source that contradicts the first one. You could write It has been reported that \"\"blah blah near daily\"\"(citation number), but I think that \"\"blah blah daily\"\". The moment you do this, however, you'll find that people will object, because what you have presented is not publically verifyable. So, what is needed here is a source, a pointer to publically verifyable information, to support your claim. The full list of newspapers would be ok, but very unpractical. If there is a single list somewhere, preferably produced by a fairly neutral source such as United Nation observers of something equivalent, that would be much easier.\\nYou might think it's much more important to tell the truth accurately, even if you don't find a source, because, after all, the truth is what it's all about. Unfortunately, there is no such thing as the truth, a universally and unanimously accepted version of events, and certainly not in the Israelian-Palestian conflict. Imagine for a moment that everybody would put their version of the truth on the page, and what the page would then look like! So, we are bound by certain rules that allow us to govern information about events without spiraling into chaos, and these very rules that exist to create accurate information state that sticking to the rules is more important that providing accurate information. Strange as it may seem, it works: even when not perfectly accurate, the result will not stray to far from the truth, if there is any one such thing, and that result is usually a fairly useful document as opposed to a flamewar.\"</td>\n",

Get the Foundation attorney or Wales to make a statement in favor of the YT projectthey've been silent, but oft-invoked by the tiny minority of deleters, to inflate themselves with self-importance. The completely idiotic \"\"hypothetical civil case\"\"potential copyviobeing used to violate wiki's own copyright policy/procedure for suspected copyvios holds no water. In fact, the hypothetical civil case of libelfalse accusations of copyvio when a copyright holder asserts permissionIS somthing to actually be concerned about. For example, if someone's copyright were being infringed, we would take a complaint from them seriously. When someone says their right to post under GDFL is being infringed and they are being libelled, we should take that seriously toocall up the Foundation lawyer. The actual fact is that any hypothetical cases of either kind, with no compliant, and which there are unlikely to be damages are cases no lawyer in the world would argue. But someone *could* get pissed off enough to sue, and that is more likely if they are being treated badly/their requests ignored re copyright either way.

Occasionally putting the worlds most versitial word 'fuck' in a sentence isn't incivil it's just stressing a point. About Eddieebo's death threat to someone, I read that, you are one dumb cunt, seriously, you are fucking stupid. That was not a death threat, there are death threats and death threats, this is the former, where it says kill but everyone should know no-one is serious about it. Maybe wikipedia should wake up to themselves, unblock Eddieebo's account, he has made some useful contributions, sure he swears a lot while talking, but thats because people like you shit him up the wall to no end. Left-wing hippies who are all about the people except when that person is right of Ghengis Khan, like Eddieebo. Well done dickhead, now I know you'll block this account, if you do you'll just prove my point. Just like the stupid muslims who violently protested the comics depicting them as violent, you guys are that stupid. Have fun blocking my account numbnuts. I know you won't listen either, you only listen to things that support your way of thinking, you'll read this, find they way it violates the rules and block me, you won't actually take anything in to that blockhead of yours. People like you think your doing the world justice, but your really just fucking up free speech. He Eddieebo actually read and understood what you and others told him then structured his arguments around them and guess what, he shat on you, seriously, Eddiebo completely ripped you a new arsehole, so you chose not to listen and block him because he put the word 'fuck' in a few places and wouldn't apologise for the death threat which wasn't really a death threat. You do know those are the actions of people who know they are wrong but can't admit it, hey I reckon eddieebo and i can admit where we are wrong, unfortunately you can't, so you abuse justice. Are you in a Western Country? If so you are actually meant to hear both sides of arguments and have a structured debate with a fair judge finally making a ruling before any punishments are imposed, I don't think any of that happened.</td>\n",

This is outrageous and completely ridiculous. I am an aviation specialist, I was general manager of large airports (among others Schiphol-Amsterdam), a professor in economics (graduated Erasmus University Rotterdam, 1973))and a consultant for many governments world wide (a.o. Netherlands, Indonesia, Chad, Philippines) on issues regarding aviation. I am a registered transport consultant at the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.I can proof that on every account. The problem with aviation accidents is that every country makes it own report of the accident, many are not in English, not all use metric systems.  Many reports are not easy to obtain, or simply (against all international rules) not available. This is very frustrating for people working in this field. Everybody likes to avoid the mistakes others made. Not everybody is American, there are also Asians, Africans, Russians, etc. who are entitled to the same knowledge as you and me. For this reason we publish for many years these reports all in the same style and the same format and all in English. This makes comparison easy. Aviation security and safety is not a joke. Because we are talking over small series and the information has to be available for many years we found the solution in publishing them as print in demand by lulu.com. I do not see what is wrong with this. Publishing via a normal publisher means that the series are too large, the books become too expensive (especially for third world countries) and after a certain time the publication is no more available. You should appreciate what we do instead of insulting us. You think we make any money out of this? Think about translation costs, not everybody works for free. This way you do not help wikipedia, but you are a stumble block. You are probably some kind of Johnny the Selfkicker.\\n\\nDr. Dirk J. Barreveld, Netherlands \\n(  )</td>\n",

I ask that you bear with me on this.\\n\\nHistory\\nFrom alpha to omega, here is an aperçu.\\nMy work on Wikipedia commenced rather abruptly when I made my debut using 207.97.213.170. My subsequent edits were along the same line. I was promptly blocked for vandalism. In retrospect, I understand that my edits were definitely not constructive, but I would not construe them as vandalism, as I was just an abecedarian then. \\n\\nI returned with Hiineedrequestforcomment to \"\"pursue defense of my actions on my previous account\"\". I was quite hostile to Jpgordon and continued to argue my case quite impolitely, insulting other users. After making my only constructive edit, I was blocked for \"\"trolling and harassment\"\". I continued to argue against my block, and my block settings were changed, disabling me from editing at all.\\n\\nI returned with The Reformed Editor, truly thinking I was reformed. I created my userpage declaring that I was the alternate account of Hiineedrequestforcomment. I made several improvements to Julia Mancuso, Shaun White, Ted Ligety, Purna, Akola city, and 2010 Winter Olympics, but then I started arguing with users about the ranking of the 2010 Winter Olympics medal table. I do admit that my actions were quite inappropriate. Après reading my userpage promulgation, Andrwsc blocked me. I asked him tersely, \"\"Does [my block] mean that all indefinitely-blocked users cannot ever return to Wikipedia to make changes, even if they are helpful?\"\" This prompted him to change the block settings of Hiineedrequestforcomment to allow me to make my offer. Here I am now.\\n\\nDeclarations\\nI pledge allegiance to Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia that anyone can edit. However, that promise has unfortunately been denied to me.\\nI promise to let sleeping dogs lie. It was my obsession with pursuing justice of that petty IP that led to my downfall.\\nI promise to continue making constructive edits. The following are the inexhaustive diffs for all the constructive edits I have made:\\nBode Miller\\nJulia Mancuso\\nShaun White\\nTed Ligety\\nPurna\\nAkola city\\n2010 Winter Olympics\\nAnd many more. . .\\nI issue an apology to all those editors who have construed me as a detriment to Wikipedia.\\n\\nFinal Thoughts\\nThe year of 2009 was an annus mirabilis, but my only regret was not coming to Wikipedia earlier.\\nTo Andrwsc: you didn't think much of my constructive edits. Yes, they may not have promoted articles to Featured Article of Good Article statuses, but nonetheless, they were improvements to the general quality of Wikipedia.Also, I don't understand why you are giving me this chance when you say at the Administrators' noticeboard that you \"\"would personally !vote oppose to an unblock\"\". Does that mean I have no chance of getting unblocked?\\nI will assay to refrain from argufying that may launch into a full-scale argumentum.\\nI hope to participate in the development of an accurate, just, collegial ambiance here on Wikipedia. For me, in the aftertime, I hope to develop mutual understanding with my fellow editors. My amour propre is quite high now, so please don't ruin it.\\nI hope you will help me help Wikipedia by unblocking me forthwith and allowing me to apply my abracadabra to those articles stark</td>\n",

The 'development' at the centre of a sonata structure is in reality a 'Durchführung'  i.e. a 'leading through' various keys. The word 'development' is a poor translation of this  and has generated a situation in which foolish people analyse a stretch of music not according to what happens in it, but in terms of what this wrong word happens to make them think of. As every German muscologist and textbook knows, the point of a 'development section' is *not* various varietites of 'thematic modification'  it is *tonal and harmonic instability* after the stability of the second-subject key and before the restoration of the tonic. Has no-one actually bothered to listen to what does   and doesn't  happen in the included extract...?!? IT'S MODULATORY, AND THAT'S ALL. \\n\\nThis article is too deeply confused to be rescued.

They reverted my contributions, deleted my hard work, gang edited my stuff, refused to compromise or in any way work for anything but their own dictatorial will. Now I'm motivated to be as asinine and ignorant as they are. I'm wholesale deleting anything without a source or reference. I'm disallowing references I personally feel are insufficient.

In this article, I included references and I hoped to create a series based on adult diaper production by country.\\n\\nWithin minutes , User:Escape Orbit slapped a speedy deletion notice onto my article, without even suggesting how to improve my article and claimed that I was 'advertising' and my page was 'unambiguously promotional'. This user did not even try to rewrite or improve this article.\\n\\nSecondly, User:Purplewowies claimed that I should have taken the advice of this helpdesk first, then create my article. However this was not possible as I had already created my article BEFORE the helpdesk replied. Maybe the helpdesk should be more quicker.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I am getting fed up of wikipedia. I am getting fed up of how admins just pounce on you if you are a newbie. I am seriously thinking of trolling and vandalising again. Good day</td>\n",
