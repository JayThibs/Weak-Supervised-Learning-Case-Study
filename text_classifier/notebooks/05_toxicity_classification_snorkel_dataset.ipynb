There are known in the most widely read and most rigorously refereed biology or science journals: even one of the papers being in Nature or PNAS would have made this a weak keep.

It's already been stuffed up due to this user's edits and had to be protected by RickK (in it's highly POV and badly structured form: at one point there were essentially TWO articles on the one page). Now CheeseDreams is making a massive change without using the talk page, and it adding sections that don't even have any content in it! I've reverted back and have requested that she bring her changes to the talk page. I would appreciate advise on how to procede with this, I don't particularly want to engage in an edit war with her. -  13:58, 14 Dec 2004 (UTC)</td>\n",

The reason I find it necessary to do this is because some elements of Chang's story, which report claims of the DI have been blithely elevated to facthood, without benefit of a critical examination of the reported claims.\\n\\nHere is my initial draft for the new section, to appear below the biography and above the discussion of the controversial DI petition.\\n\\nControversial New York Times Story\\n\\nIn February 2006, the New York Times ran an investigative story Few Biologists but Many Evangelicals Sign Anti-Evolution Petition by Kenneth Chang of the New York Times Science Desk, reporting that the Discovery Institute had launched a new websiteDissent From Darwin to promote their expanded public relations campaign regarding how theories of evolution should be taught in public school.  The new website included a list of signatories to an earlier petition which the Discovery Institute had termed \"\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism.\"\"Signatories of 'A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism' The petition dated back to 2001 when it was first published by the Discovery Institute beneath an ad criticizing a forthcoming PBS series on evolution.2001 \"\"100 Scientists\"\" Ad]  The headline on the Discovery Institute's 2001 ad was also \"\"A Scientific Dissent From Darwinism,\"\" although the petition itself, embedded at the bottom of the ad, did not carry that label (it bore no label at all).  The untitled 2001 version of the petition simply read, \"\"We are skeptical of claims for the ability of random mutation and natural selection to account for the complexity of life. Careful examination of the evidence for Darwinian theory should be encouraged.\"\" \\n\\nChang's story disclosed that Professor Picard's name appeared on the petition cited by the newly launched Dissent From Darwin website, but the Times article did not distinguish which version she signed.  Indeed, Professor Picard's name first appeared on the original 2001 untitled two-sentence petition and her name remained on the subsequent controversially yclept versions, including the most recent one appearing on the new website.  Chang's story neither substantiated nor refuted the claims of the Discovery Institute that the two-sentence petition supported or endorsed DI's slant on its meaning, but the story did include a mixture of quotes from some of the people whose names appeared on the list at different times, including some quotes that cast doubt on the Discovery Institute's characterization of all the petition signers as variously \"\"dissenters from Darwinism\"\" or \"\"anti-evolution.\"\"  Chang's story, in conjunction with the Discovery Institute's website and its attached list of petition signers left a wake of confusion over who among the list of signers of the earlier versions of the petition agreed with or consented to the Discovery Institute's characterization of the petition signers as \"\"anti-evolution\"\" \"\"dissenters\"\" who presumably supported the emerging and evolving agenda of the Discovery Institute.  It is at present unknown to what degree, if any, Picard agrees with or supports the Discovery Institute's controversial interpretation of the petition as \"\"dissent.\"\"  It is also unknown whether Picard has ever supported any or all of the ongoing political agenda of the Discovery Institute.\\n\\nThe last two sentences of the proposed new section reflect the absence of verifiable published information regarding the attitude of most of the original 103 signers.  So far, Wikipedia has only managed to obtain a reliably sourced comment from Stanley N. Salthe, who disputed DI's characterization and supplied his own salty attitude, \"\"A plague on both their houses.\"\"  \\n\\nSkip Evans of the NSCE similarly casts doubt on the DI's interpretation, saying\\n\\n\\nThe Statement\\nThe signatories appear to attest to a statement about the ability of natural selection to \"\"account for the complexity of life\"\" - in other words, a statement about how evolution t</td>\n",

I've had issues with both Furper and Beam... who seem to be admins that heavily favour FYROM. I've officially complained on the notice board about their threats to block, edit behavior and unusually close relationships with obvious FYROM POV members of Wikipedia.  (specifically Balkanfever) \\n\\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard#This_anon_.28apparently_User:Crossthets.29.2C_is_an_apparent_POV_Pusher.2C_evidence_below\\n\\nAs I said verbatim on Politis talk_page...\\n\\nThis is a difficult battle because so far I am alone at the moment, I am a newbie, and as I said to one of the admins on notice board... I feel like someone reporting a bad cop at a policeman's ball.  However, I still plan to follow up soon with a precise listing of what I perceive as non-NPOV behavior by these admins. I noticed while researching this issue you've also have problems with them. Would it be possible to list any problems on your talk page here so I can add them to my report to show I am not alone? Furthermore... since you have been around longer you probably know more Greeks than me around here. Would it be possible to also contact them to ask them if they've also had problems with those two... and (if so) add those incidents to your list?  (and perhaps get them to contact others?) \\n\\nWhere one person could be bullied with threats of blocking... the concerns of many will be taken much more seriously. I will check back here in a couple of days. Have courage. Regards 209.161.238.86</td>\n",

Also, to say that your main focus is not his incivility, while true, ignores the fact that it was brought up enough at ArbCom to generate a \"\"reprimand\"\" and it has been brought up since at various talk pages as he re-invigorates old issues. And another thing, you must realise that he personally targets you because he feels personally targeted? I have tried to advise PHG to leave this whole topic area well alone for a while (~a year) until heads have utterly cooled. This won't work, however, if you follow him around tagging his articles, like the France-Japan one. Whatever the merits or value of that (I'm unsure either way yet), it demonstrates the need for a better and broader solution than the current ArbCom one. Frankly, I like your sourcing amendment, I'd even consider lessening the length of the ban if PHG were willing to comply with your amendation for the good of the project, since I think sourcing is the major issue here.   \"</td>\n",

While many people believe this concept - some even go to great lengths to self publish books on the topics, there is no way to scientifically prove the concept, nor is there any way to verify generally accepted documents that could show this is even a possibility.  The rumor that Harding was black rages about based on two quotes, one by Harding himself (where he says he doesn't know if it could be true, the other a rumor started by his future father-in-law meant to destroy Harding's business and reputation.) Consider verifiable these FACTS on the matter:\\n1) Harding's alleged \"\"black\"\" lineage can not be proven through United States Census forms, death certificate, or any other PRIMARY SOURCE document.  As far back as the 1850 census (the first to name all people enumerated, and designate their race) Harding's father and mother are enumerated as white.  This is most frequently dismissed by Harding Conspiracy followers who claim the census forms were doctored after the fact as part of a Federal Government cover-up.\\n\\n2) There is no DNA proof of Harding's alleged \"\"black blood\"\", (nor is there proof that Harding fathered Elizabeth Ann Christian).\\n\\n3) Harding was not raised as a cultural \"\"black\"\" that is to say that he was not raised within the black community, and therefore would have not had the same cultural experiences that other blacks in the era would have had.\\n\\n4) \"\"Black Harding\"\" promoters will point to William Estabrook Chancellor's book on Harding as proof of government conspiracy.  And it is interesting how swifty the government worked to squash the book and get its copies.  But if one looks at Chancellor's research methodology (and we step away from those who claim that the book was supressed) - all of it based on hearsay - any student in college today who would present this type of research in the form of a paper, masters thesis or dissertation would have been thrown out of college for faulty research!   \\n\\n5) Some of the promoters of this theory of Harding's \"\"blackness\"\" on \"\"family stories\"\".  While folklore is not always untrue, folklore can be embellished from storyteller to storyteller. Ask anyone who studies it, folklore is at the mercy of the one who passes it on.\\n\\n6) The promoters of these theories go to great lengths to attack the people who poke logical holes in their wishful arguments. They can not refute the facts, so they attack the people who question their beliefs. Take a look at the \"\"reviews\"\" of Harding books published in the past ten years in places like Amazon and B&amp;N; online and you'll get an idea how some people will attack those who do not buy into the black \"\"Black Harding\"\" myth.\\n\\nIf Wikipedia were to add information that Harding was the first black President, without irrfetable proof, it simply ads another chain in the long list of unrliable misinformation.   \\n\\n\"</td>\n",

Moreover, all future helicopter purchases are most likely going to be either Army or RAN .  Therefore, we either remove all RAN and Army aircraft or we move the page to 'List of aircraft of the ADF'.

Instead someone doesn't warn Hersford for his bad choice?  Please note his long excuse filled statement on his page.  Does that not read like an attack on me?  I don't like to be attacked, and he was caught for a big mistake, so instead of immediately reconsidering his mistake, he went on the attack.  An age-old public relations ploy, which I don't buy.  Hersford may or may not be a racist, but he certainly let an avowed racist get away with something.  Sad.   Talk• Contributions \\n\"</td>\n",

The fact that, for the two years ending last Sunday, the account  was almost entirely inactive, its only contributions being changes in spelling, pruning of video-game weapon descriptions, and racial invective, makes it suspect as a part-time puppet account, or perhaps an artificially-aged shell-identity.  In the past week, it has made nearly as many edits as it had since its inception some years ago.  What's more, these have caused considerable disruption in the community.  I have seen this pattern of behaviour before in destructive users who are trying either to deflect guilt and reprisal from yourself onto other Wikipedians, or to make a name for a vandalism-only account by artlessly effecting a major change, such as an article deletion or a user block.\\n\\nBe warned that your actions have not gone unnoticed.</td>\n",
