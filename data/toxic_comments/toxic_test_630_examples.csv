Fair use rationale for Image:Loleatta Holloway.jpg

This file may be deleted.
Thanks for uploading Image:Loleatta Holloway.jpg. I notice the 'image' page specifies that the image is being used under fair use but there is no explanation or rationale as to why its use in Wikipedia articles constitutes fair use. When you use a generic fair use tag such as {{fair use}} or {{fair use in|article name}}, you must also write out on the image description page a specific explanation or rationale for why using this image in each article is consistent with fair use.

Please go to the image description page and edit it to include a fair use rationale.

If you have uploaded other fair use media, consider checking that you have specified the fair use rationale on those pages too. You can find a list of 'image' pages you have edited by clicking on the """"my contributions"""" link (it is located at the very top of any Wikipedia page when you are logged in), and then selecting """"Image"""" from the dropdown box. Note that any fair use images lacking such an explanation will be deleted one week after they have been uploaded, as described on criteria for speedy deletion. If you have any questions please ask them at the Media copyright questions page. Thank you.  """,0

 European Court of Human Rights's Decision is NOT a DEFAMATORY content 
You warned me to add """"defamatory content"""" in Talk:Armenian Genocide page (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Armenian_Genocide). Notice that what I added is the DECISION OF EUROPEAN COURT OF HUMAN RIGHTS about Armenian """"Genocide"""". You CANNOT LABEL the decision of ECtHR as """"Defamatory Content"""". I will complain about you in related Wikipedia forums.
Notice and think twice whether the following content is defamatory:
 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event 
This must be added to the article:
On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

 Gregory Gilligan Rust (Reporter) 

Greg Rust (born 19 July 1970 in Sydney) is an Australian Formula One expert and commentator with Network Ten, a commercial TV network. He has also worked for the Nine Network and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a freelance commentator/reporter/presenter, mainly covering motorsport (auto racing).  Colleagues and fans call him """"Rusty"""" or """"Thruster"""" (a nickname given to him by the late Barry Sheene a former World Motorcycle Champion).
 Radio career 

Worked for 3 years with the Macquarie Radio Network  stations 2GB and 2CH in Sydney initially as a sport reporter and later became daytime news reader.

 Television career 

After cutting his teeth with SBS motorsport program Speedweek, Rust was drafted into Channel 9's commentary team for the final Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at the Eastern Creek Raceway in 1996. He called the support races with 1980 F1 World Champ Alan Jones. In 1997 he was hired by Ten to host the Australian Super Touring Championship for 2-litre Touring Cars - a position previously held by his close friend Leigh Diffey who had moved on to Network Ten's V8 Supercar coverage.  Rust commentated the Aust. Super Touring Championship for 2 years before starting work as V8 pit reporter late in '98. He was a part of Ten's V8 coverage for almost 10 years - even hosting and anchoring the commentary on occasions.  During this period the station won numerous Logie Awards for its broadcast of the famous Bathurst 1000 and Rusty developed a reputation as a pit specialist also working on the Gold Coast Champ Car race and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne. Despite an offer to join the Seven Network in 2007, Rust stayed with Ten to front the station's MotoGP and F1 broadcasts and its long running magazine motorsport show RPM.  He also hosts and commentates Ten's coverage of the Red Bull Air Race series.

 Racing background 

Born into a family with a genuine love for all forms of motorsport, he was a regular at the Sydney Showground Speedway before he could even walk   and an amateur racer who started out in Karts.  In his late teens and early 20’s, Rust enjoyed some class wins as a driver in rallysprints and khana-crosses.  He has also driven V8 Supercars, Formula Holden, Formula Ford, Toyota Racing Series and Speedcars/Midgets for story research.

As one person notes on the history page, even through I am the author for several of the seminal works (no other person on the planet has written all the main english language handbooks, or the seminal articles in the mainstream published literature, or the two seminal works in TIME and Forbes web pages), this is solid constructivce information that should not be dismissed.

And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",1

I've been using Wikipedia for years, but only last month did I start editing.

I usually lurk in the Recent Changes area, watching for vandals with the help of Twinkle. I am working on a Bot in spare time, and hope to have him up and running soon.

As much as PBS is a a part of my life I tired, several years ago, of how they mess with the British programs. So I bought myself a region free DVD player and have been ordering the series from Amazon UK. Amazingly the product is often cheaper - even with the shipping costs - than buying the DVDs from Amazon US and I get to see the programs before they air on PBS or BBC America - or as I know call it the Top Gear/Gordan Ramsey channel. Sherlock has been brilliant and I love the jokes about Mycroft's weight. Speaking of Mark Gatiss who would have thought that one of The League of Gentleman zanies would be doing so many interesting things today.

Under the criteria for speedy deletion, articles that do not assert the subject's importance or significance may be deleted at any time. Please see the guidelines for what is generally accepted as notable. 

If you think that you can assert the notability of the subject, you may contest the deletion by adding  to the top of the page (just below the existing speedy deletion or """"db"""" tag), coupled with adding a note on the article's talk page explaining your position, but be aware that once tagged for speedy deletion, if the article meets the criterion it may be deleted without delay.

Not everyone checks user and talk pages to see courtesy postings about online status, etc.  Sorry that you find my attempt to be courteous to other Wikipedians """"annoying"""".  In the past, you (and others) have not understand my comments (see the archives); as you (and others) seem to mistinterpret what I write and to read intentions in what I write that I do not have, I have suggested that you (and some of these others) not engage in these kinds of exchanges with me; I do not find them productive.
I am replying only out of courtesy and so that eventually this exchange can be archived by the automatic archiving bot.
There is no """"rule"""" or """"guideline"""" in Wikipedia that one must reply to every comment in one's user talk page or an article talk page.  Replying is up to one's own discretion and time constraints (""""schedule""""). There is no requirement that editors must spend their time editing Wikipedia; WP:POL states the opposite; that one should not be criticized for how one chooses to spend one's own time.  That is the prerogative of each of us.  How we express ourselves, as long as it is courteous, is also up to each of us.  If we want to take our time to criticize others, we need to keep in mind that we are doing so in public space and that our criticisms are being read by whoever logs on to that space.
From my own perspective, I find the comment posted above gratuitous and unnecessary.  Irrespective of that comment, I will continue to post what I consider a courtesy to others since that is how I intend it to be.  I do not intend to annoy anyone.  The guidelines for how to address other users are in Wikipedia:Etiquette, WP:NPA, and other places linked in WP:POL.  I try to follow these guidelines in what I post in Wikipedia. To assume otherwise is to violate WP:AGF.  I am posting this reply in good faith as well.   

To others who might be more interested than some in why I may not reply quickly or at all: I explain that in """"N.B."""", but not everyone consults a user's talk page when commenting in article talk pages, and so some may not see that explanation in """"N.B."""" above; therefore, I have mentioned that I would be offline in some of my recent comments in talk page article(s) that I have worked hard on in the past.  I will be back offline after this reply and will not see what anyone posts here until I return to check the functioning of the achiving bot (I don't know when that will be).  I have a massive amount of work to do offline over the next two weeks, which has been delayed in getting to me (thus I've been online occasionally in the past week from time to time), but I expect to be away from Wikipedia after this reply for indefinite and extended periods of time both during and after the next two weeks as well (on an extended """"wikibreak""""; please see the template notice above).

 WP:SPA / sockpuppet accounts 

Admins: Please note that per Wikipedia:Requests_for_arbitration/St_Christopher, accounts which have the single purpose of editing this article and its talk page may be considered as a single editor, are restrained from making disruptive edits, and may be banned if they do so.  Current single purpose accounts are:   

This is how Leuko typically tries to deal with editors who don't agree with his point of view when editing this article, he tries to silence them rather than hash it out in good faith. You can see that my account in not single purpose since I have a number of edits (minor, but still edits, I'm more of a WikiGnome in other areas) in other articles. You will also notice that even though  

Actually 75% of the contribs from this IP address are related to this article, so considering other people may have made some of the non-related edits, that indicates that this is a WP:SPA for editing this article. I grouped the SPA's together because as the ArbCom case said, they can be regarded as a single editor using sockpuppets when editing disruptively. I'll add the other one too if it makes you happy. I try and WP:AGF too, but it's hard with the history of abusive sockpuppetry and personal attacks perpetuated in the past, which still continues.  

75% means that 1 out of 4 edits has been on articles outside this area, that's not a terrible ratio, and certainly shows this is not a WP:SPA. Also, if you look at the quality of the edits you will notice that the majority of that 75% are to rephrase comments I have made or simple/minor spacing or formatting issues. It may be your opinion that the edits by the users you listed were """"disruptive"""" but I doubt you will find a reasonable person that will agree with you on this. I agree that it's unfortunate that some biased editors continue there attacks and campaign of disinformation but it seems that some people just can't help themselves.  

Demanding that information be removed because other editors would not provide you with a physical copy of a newspaper article which is cited is definitely not productive.  Now I had to look up what a buckytube was, but I don't think this comment was very supportive of the nature of the edits on this page: .  

Well, that's your opinion. Actually, since you were able to prove the existence of the article without a physical copy demonstrates that it was rather easy to obtain verification. I don't think asking for verification for information that is included in an article in what is supposedly an """"encyclopedia"""" is asking too much. Without verification Wikipedia would be no better than any other garbage out there on the internet. Do you really think that even basic verification to prove that material even existed is unnecessary?  

Yes, it was rather easy to obtain for someone who had the desire to actually re-verify a source which has been there for a year. I don't know why it needed to be such a difficult process.  

You tell me, you were the one that was complaining about it being so difficult.

Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman""",1

 Terms not concepts 
I think at some point I saw in my watchlist a comment from someone about some kind of term not being a concept. I was puzzled at the time, and now today you have reverted the inclusion of a terms category in a concepts category. (I am wondering if that was you not too long ago). I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression? I'm in a pretty embarrassing spot here, as pretty clearly any term is also a concept (this is not intended to count for physical objects which can also be """"thought of""""). The only question is about organizing the subject matter according to some ontology that makes sense. There are many """"terminology"""" categories, and I basically see them as """"junk"""" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up. I can't be everywhere, but in the areas I take care of, I dutifully remove articles from """"terminology"""" categories and place them in the appropriate subcategory of """"concepts"""". So please help me understand where you are coming from. Perhaps give me an example of a term that is not a concept.  (talk) """,0

Dishonest, misleading, misinformation campaigns like these are very harmful to the pragmatic solutions to protect the environment, so it's pretty disheartening that somemthing I'm involved in, Wikipedia, is being abused to this extent. The dishonest manipulation of sources, the smearing, and the bullying cabalism are very discouraging. But the world is not a perfect place. I smiled at a few of the discussions on your page.

 Proper pronunciation of NVIDIA?? 

I'll ask one more time, very, very seriously:  Can anyone cite a reliable written source which definitively says how the NVIDIA muckamucks intend for """"NVIDIA"""" to be pronounced?  For some time now, the article said /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/, but someone changed it just now to say /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/.

As I said several months ago (see Talk:Nvidia#The way it's meant to be pronounced? above), I am, personally, absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that NVIDIA's own pronunciation of its name (based on the audio of the animated logo at the start of a recent game) is /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (""""inn-VID-ee-uh"""", with the first two vowels being identical).  I know some other people seem equally absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that the correct pronunciation is /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (""""en-VID-ee-uh""""), and the only explanation I can come up with for this discrepancy is that those people's speech may have the """"pin-pen merger"""" (please go read that if you aren't familiar with the term) — whereas my own speech does not have the pin-pen merger, and I therefore """"hear"""" the pronunciation differently from some other people.  Or, perhaps the person whose voice was recorded for the NVIDIA animated logo happens to speak a regional dialect with the pin-pen merger, and none of the NVIDIA execs have noticed or cared.

My first impulse, just now, was to simply revert the latest edit and put the text back the way it was before (/ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/).  My second impulse was to leave it as it now is, but put a {{fact}} tag on the pronunciation until someone can supply a reliable source.  But if no one can come up with a source, I believe it's better not to give any pronunciation until/unless it can be reliably sourced.    """,0

""""The Amazing Spiderman 2""""
Hi, I apologize in advance for not knowing the Wikipedia procedures for this type of thing, but I wanted to point out that """"The Amazing Spider-Man 2"""" is listed in his filmography. First, this film did not come out in 2013 as indicated by the table and will not come out until this year, and second, Martin Sheen will not be in """"The Amazing Spider-Man 2"""" as 
((SPOILER))

his character, Uncle Ben, was killed in the first movie in the series revamp, """"The Amazing Spider-Man,"""" which was a 2013 film.   — Preceding unsigned comment added by 68.57.42.233   """,1

The reality is that free software just wants to survive in a hererogenous network based on open standards to ensure interoperability with everyone else; while Microsoft has a 90% share of desktops and is leveraging this to displace open standards in an attempt to kill free software. This strategy was outlined by a MS staffer years ago in the first of the Halloween documents.
 The Microsoft-Novell agreement is completely irrelevant, because (1) Microsoft owns just two of the 125 patents in the VC-1 licensing pool, and is not in a position to license the other 123 to Novell, Linux or anyone else; and (2) Novell is not Linux. It is one of hundreds of companies that work in whole or in part in the Linux arena. None of the others benefit in any way from the agreement. On the contrary, the agreement is generally being interpreted by the Linux community as a threat.
 Ffmpeg stuff is legally dodgy in the USA because that jurisdiction has software patents.
 SVG/XAML: AIUI the gist of the criticism from the sources cited is that (1) Microsoft has chosen to implement SVG-type functionality within XAML/Silverlight rather than as generic SVG within Internet Explorer. (IE is the only major browser that lacks SVG. This has rendered a useful W3C open standard largely unusable.) (2) XAML is itself a standards-buster, because it mimics W3C stuff (e.g. bits of CSS2) in an incompatible way.",0

 well, I saw that I'm appreciate by you , do not worry about me, mister PaleCloudedWhite (it is funny for me WhiteCloud-NubeBlanca an indian character in a old Hollywood movie). I am not resentful about anything, not matter, I'm Spaniard these days I'm watching movies and very bussy with my first trip to U.K., and I'm preparing a trip to Tarragona too, and another to Huesca. I hope you will don't forget the botany. Wikedia don't pay me money, you know it, It is just for help people. S.M.P. could upset, but she is very bussy these days and besides... Well, mister, please don't quit botany. I hope you will write about it. I don't need to have any user account to write here. There is much work to do and it takes time. I can tell you that I use several books as """"ANIMALI Come sono. Done vivono. Come vivono"""" from an italian Edizioni Labor-Milano by a group with G. Scortecci, director del instituto de la Universidad de Génova (Chenoa) translated in 1960 to spanish by """"Vergara Editorial"""". So, I translated from spanish to english a text of italian origen. I prefer mostly fishes anphibians and lizards, in this order. But as you know  I used to write too, about plants that are totally unknown for me. I hope in future to visit the Mamut caves in Kentucky and see the blind fishes. We use to create new pages with an account because it is requested by Wikipedia. I wish best regards for  Nadiatalent-Sminthopsis84 she must be very young. I cannot speak about S.M.P. this is internet, you know, she is not writing long time ago, but it is not important neither. I would like that you can try people will write about botany, other Wikipedias have more information. I know that there are other webs with botany topics, but Wikipedia allows to jump between pages. Well, I must watch my movies, and write my homework. You can visit """"http://www.fotolog.com """" if you like about the song. I love basque girls. You could visit Donosti beach """"Playa de la Concha, en San Sebastian"""", I hope speak you in the future, and I hope your help too. The articles are best with you and other people writing it. I would like write to Nadiatalent-ST84, but she has forbidden me, and S.M.P. could read about it too. Well a hug for you, mister P.C.W. (Gran jefe NubeBlanca) from me: C.C.

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

129605,b54c9836601eb78a,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred

122476,8f2bc002c8e07080,"Dear few wiki editors who claim now to own wiki
When these things become personal they can become petty. I don’t believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being. Wiki doesn’t work that way. Neither do computers. You might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships. But you’ll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isn’t entirely your own. Unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations.
I was informed of the recent spate of death threats against Sharmila via a Mumbai Activist who received a message from a Manipuri who didn’t want to be named. I asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the Authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do. What the Nazis told the Jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them, that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens. Even the memory of their existence would be expunged. Yes in that I am comparing you to a bunch of Nazis. I don’t know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it.
 On 7th November at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national Indian Television News Channel managed an 11 minute interview with Sharmila. You may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations, sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic. Wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters. 
The page on Irom Sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense. Content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on UFO sightings, the history of double entry bookkeeping or Irom Sharmila. 
Some examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long list of the Nobel Prize so he removed her nomination based on his opinion that long list nominations are not noteworthy. Hundreds of people are nominated every year for the long list. But there are now 7 billion people on this planet and I don’t believe any wiki editor has ever received a nomination or personally knows anyone who has. The short list is not published so wiki editors could argue it’s pure speculation. However informed opinion is published yearly by several respected organizations I believe one is called the Olaf trust (google is very helpful try it). For at least two consecutive years they have posited Sharmila as a possible on the short list which is always a single figure guess. Wiki editors have removed most of the smaller prizes offered to Sharmila because they didn’t like the Indian sounding names of the awards but they were fully referenced. Similarly they have removed at least one puppet production and two dance theatre productions about her. The graffiti image of her from Mumbhai is iconic. But because it wasn’t done by Banksy the snobbery of western wiki editors had it expunged. These people never use their real names and are bringing the concept of a free and open knowledge database into disrepute by the bullying and intimidation of anyone who disagrees with their nasty tactics in the case of this article. 
Unless other wiki editors stand up to these petty racists who know nothing about India Manipur or Irom Sharmila yet pontificate on what can be posted here and now claim absolute power to remove any other editor who disagrees with them wiki is already dead. Hundreds will come to the article to learn more about Sharmila having read something somewhere and all will now leave disappointed because it adds nothing. The prime wiki editor of a people’s encylopaedia is people. The downside of giving the unqualified this sort of power is you reduce the quality and content of articles when ignorant bigot gangs take up personal vendettas. I presume the hope was you would only edit articles you where you had some knowledge of the subject. But some feel that they have now become professionalized wiki editors although they don’t need any outside reference to qualify them as experts.
But back to the last key event that wiki will not allow to be noted along with many others. Usually before an interview the press are cautioned not to report any criticism of the Government of Manipur otherwise the privilege given to them will be removed. There’s an unspoken threat also that scribes have low life expectancy in Manipur. Manipur is like Sri Lanka only",0

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

That's still wrong. Nobody knows who Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta is other than her mother, and Lady Gaga is the name her famous so that is appropriate, as is Madonna's since virtually no one would know her by her real name. However, in the case of real people and not stagenames, it seems inappropriate, certainly illiterate and uneducated to title an article by his nickname, especially when he is not generally known by that name. It is the same thing for New York U.S. Senator, """"Chuck Schumer"""" which is purely his advertising name, promoted by his marketing staff, since his name that he was known entirely by for most of his political career, and until very recently, was """"Charles"""". However, to humanize him, as """"Jim"""" Inhofe's staff has done with him for marketing purposes, rather than James for which the other 49 states and the international population know him as, is both misleading and essentially promoting informalism as an accepted format for an encyclopaedia. And informalism ought to be attributed to poor scholarship and simple, less educated work - not an excuse for poor workmanship...   """,0

I'm not sure I'm even supposed to say thank you for helping rescue an article (Florence House), but I will. Thank you taking the time to review it and make your decision. The article can be improved, I know, but it's good that it's got that chance here on Wikipedia.",0

See Internet_Explorer#Market share history overview by year and version. IE7 is with us for some time to come, like it or not. But if others using it have no problems, that's fine, I'm not worried about my specific workplace.  come howl! """,0
