Also, everything you linked to Dennis Brown, was quite obviously meant as humor. """"ALL I DID WAS TELL THE TRUTH ABOUT COAL WITH SOURCES. Those who blocked me ARE IN THE POCKET OF BIG COAL AND I EXPOSED THEIR NEFARIOUS plots. Please FREE KINGSHOWMAN!"""" 

Don't Wikipedia editors catch obvious attempts at humour? Perhaps you didn't find them funny, but they were meant as attempts at levity during the heated so-called """"Coal Wars"""". I was also not entirely alone in the position I took there on coal which was simply that a paragraph needed to be added to the lead to reflect Coal's Health and Environmental Effects. I wasn't taking an unreasonable position, and you will now see, that thanks to my tireless, thankless efforts to improve this encylopedia, that information is now in the lead on Coal. (not through reverts by me, but by others who agreed with my position.) I have not edited coal since my block, so I'm not quite sure how it makes sense to blocvk me again for something that I haven't gone back to doing.

Also, I did not harrass Flyer22. She harrassed me. May I relate the course of events,  which you may verify? First of all, I stopped communicating with her since she requested that I do so. Second of all, she got steamed because I added a paragraph on Nietzsche to her """"Happiness"""" article under the section """"Philsoophy of Happiness."""" Arguably (as other editors agreed) Nietzsche may have something valuable to say here, and I very quiickly made a summary of the SEP article on Nietzsche's moral philosophy on this topic. No, it wasn't perfect and the referencing could have used improvement, but it was better than omitting it and leaving readers with a somewhat one-sided impression of the Great Philosophers on Happiness. Flyer22 reverted my edit, giving a basically spurious reason: """"Unsourced"""" as I recall. But it was directed to THE MOST RELIABLE source on Philosophy, by general and academic consensus, the SEP. It would in fact be very easy to improve a great deal of Wiki Philosophy articles by just having editors sum up information from this wonderful free, peer-reviewed, academically rigorous resource.

Then, withouit provocation, after I asked her what exactly she found problematic about including Nietzsche in a list of philosophers who have written about Happiness, including similar statured luminaries like Augustine, Aquinas, Aristotle, Mill, etc. she responded, not by listing what was wrong with my Happiness edit, but by telling me """"ALL OF YOUR EDITS ARE POOR, PURE AND SIMPLE. YOU ARE A POOR EDITOR."""" I thought this was rather rude and ignorant, especfially as she saw fit to specifically attack my Hume edits (when Hume was not under discussion) telling me """"your edits on Hume largely consit of such (read=poor) edits and I'm tempted to revert them."""" Since I hate to see a poor soul suffering under the weight of such crushing temptation, I gave in to the temptation myself, and deleted all of my contributions from this encylopedia. Within hours, a throng of rebellion began to emerge,. a grass-roots protest movement which demanded the immediate return of all the much-loved Kingshowman edits to the encylopedia. Editors rushed to my defense. I told Flyer22 to eat crow and admit that, contra her opinion, my Hume edits and contributions to this beloved tome of knowledge were not so poor after all. She declined and escalated her attacks. She was the one who harrassed me, and I thought we were done with this sordid little episode until she popped back up, eager to participate in the latest round of mob justice.   Kingshowman""",1

The european translator, assumed that since hafez was a follower of sufism and love in sufism had sometimes been pederastic, therefore the beloved should have been a young boy. Well, I am looking at the persian version of the verses translated by  Henry Wilberforce-Clarke, and as person whose mother tongue is persian it seems to me that the beloved was an adult female rather than a young boy. Since hafez is using pronouns to refer to his beloved and the cupbeareand, one could go both ways but in persian we always use the phrase 'lock of hair of the beloved' to refer to females (since they have long hair you know). Besides anyone who is familiar with hafez poetry and have an advance understanding of medieval persian language, would know that Hafez is very unlikely to have pederastic inclinations.
I am well aware of the existance pederasty in many teachings of sufism and I have seen the pederastic sentiments in Jami and Saadi poems but Not all persian poets that follow sufism have pederastic inclinations!!.",0

If you type in www.espn.com (or click on the link), you will see the address in your browser change to http://espn.go.com.

 The Burke Group 

In response,  I never provided where he went to school.   I added  he is a J.D.    RAther than delete he is a J.D. (Juris Doctor)  then refer to him as Dr.  David Burke?  A J.D. is a Doctor of Jurisprudence same as a Ph.D.   Why do you allow personal information that's good for you but not for others who might be interested in knowing more?  He was important enough to post an article so why do you think any reader will be satisfied with a sum total of data saying  he owns a rental property in Agoura Hills with a meaningless political contribution?  The property posted is a rental  where he no longer lives and maybe never did.   How is that useful in an article about organized labour? You said it yourself the article should be about the company.  But in actual fact, he IS the company.    He's a flight instructor whom I know from our FBO (Flight Base Operation).  Lots of people know him.   He hasn't contributed to Republicans for years.  Look at the site you  provided!!  Last one was 2004.  Why continue to keep outdated useless information?  The article cited by Dr. John Logan, a very learned fellow, contains some useful info but also contains factually incorrect information. Even he can make mistakes.   I am a lawyer and Logan is a British economist, and may understand E.U. law but does not understand U.S. labor law.  Just because he writes about it does not mean he understands it.  There is NO newspaper article about CDN that says employees were awarded from the Court of Appeals.  He wrote incorrectly.    The citation provided which corrects his article  is  from the court dockets.  Which is a better citation?    I provided the citation from  the law firm that WON the civil case against CDN!!   I removed nothing  about the case itself.... only corrected the information in such a way that the non legal lay person could understand the fundamental differences between NLRB law and DOL law and civil actions filed with the District Courts.   What John Logan wrote that you cite is liking saying someone was cited by the F.A.A. but tried at the D.M.V.!!!  Are you British?  F.A.A. is Federal Aviation Admin. and D.M.V. is Dept. of Motor Vehicles.  They are not related anymore than NLRB is to District Court or civil cases..   Burke works in NLRB jurisdiction and the case you cite is a Civil Action in District Courts not related.    If you want CDN  discussed,  first part is fine but the civil action is not.  there should be another topic developed in wikipedia for CDN.    Logan's article  used as a citation  lacks any credible legal citation connecting Burke to the civil case.   Only a legal citation should be used.   There are none available.    DJB is a very well known person and lots of lawyers both company and union know him. No matter which side of the aisle...this information is flawed.    If you are going to discuss legal issues then get them right.  Am I being picky?  Yes.  Inside the law you can't just throw something at the ceiling and hope it sticks.   Deleting FACTS for FICTION is beneath the dignity of what Wikipedia has strived to promote.    Why do you say the article contains everything anyone needs to know to justify deleting contributions?   How is that possible when Wikipedia is an opened forum for knowledgeable people to build and add more?  You think the sum total for the reader should be that Burke owns a rental property in Agoura HIlls?  How is that related to THe Burke Group?

Post Scriptum: There are few photos about  tropical plant genera, even there are not any photo about some tropical families, please, looking for at least 1 photo for every family of plants, and every genera. There are plenty of photos about species of herbs very likely. 88.19.159.146   

P.S.2 — sorry, again, these nicknames are funny to me P.C.W. sounds me the first time """"Paleo White Cloud""""  old white cloud- Paleo white cloud- Paleo nube- Paleo nube blanca. Nadiatalent sounds like nadietalent-without talent- nobodytalent- ningún talento- estalentao- silly. 
Sminthopsis84 sounds us as Mint thopsis, but """"thopsis"""" remind me """"Hering boxes without """"topses""""
sandals were for Clementine..."""" Mint Topses"""" from the Clementine song. (what is a topse???) every thing was too much funny. I imagined to P.C.W. as an old chief indian with a very long white beard, as a Sant Claus with feathers, and NT as a slavian """"Calamity Jane"""" with bad temper, mini-skirt, long legs, Mint fragance and blueyes. I must say that I love this type of girls. I did an effort trying to be serious, but I thought """"what a crazy people"""" I don't want annoy anyone, and I prefer to be polite with people with a hysterical behaviour, I repeat , I prefer to be silent,to be quiet with crazy people. I never wanted annoy anyone. I want apologize with every people if I did they feel bad. C.C.88.19.159.146  
  

P.S.3- S.M.P. dislikes when I speak some women, mostly good looking ones as: Sarah Stierch, even if they live in the other corner of the world.

Reply to vandal Wakkeenah
To all the vandals and so called just administrators, the air dates are minor problems, the facts and details surrounding Reeves suicided are not being written well enough, as everybody else is reporting, the fact that Reeves was to fight Moore next day, is also being reverted, this is pure vandalism. As far as spelling goes by Vesa or Projects or whoever, well, if you keep on repeating yourself and have no time, some spelling errors might occur, but it's not the spelling that counts but content which is being vandalised by so called just users and administrators of this so called just wikipedia. And it is obvious wahkeenah has some personal interest in this, proof: All over internet we have Reeves' death explained in detail and possible people involved, but over here he is taking everything down, the idiotic administratotors are reversing it, thus making themselves look stupid and ignorant by not realizing the historical facts.""",1

Hello, and welcome to Wikipedia. Thank you for your contributions.

Currently, you are editing without a username. You can continue to do so, as you are not required to log in to Wikipedia to read and edit articles; however, logging in will result in a username being shown instead of your IP address (yours is 75.3.54.221).

 Do not add unreasonable contents into any articles, such as copyrighted text, advertisement messages, and text that is not related to an article's subject. Adding such content or editing articles maliciously is considered vandalism.

The Wikipedia Tutorial is a good place to start learning about Wikipedia.

I agree with your statements and the reverts. I would like to add some different thoughts.
I prefer incremental addition of material, because it ensures a proper peer-review process. Adding 60kb on a single day is just too much to control. 
The sudden addition of long paragraphs also raises the question where this material comes from. Of course, the editor might be extremely gifted and produce an unbelievable amount of information in almost no time. But suspicions that the material is copy-pasted are not too far fetched, I think. Especially, when seeing that the style differs drastically between different section (e.g., the way references are coded). I would appreciate, if you (User:Historian19) could enlighten us about this question.

 Various explanations 

The Law School is the only other major graduate school that belongs to UM, so I added it to the intro with the Med School and Marine School.

There is not enough content to split off to make into a separate article on the Business School just because the GA reviewer said that it could be split off.

None of the links to the Miami Herald or Sun Sentinel articles actually point to the articles that they used to because they've been kicked off to the archives.

A whole paragraph dedicated to the strike is not necessary considering that there is a mention of the strike two paragraphs earlier.

I don't know why the Iron Arrow paragraph was removed at all. This just looks like more of Racepacket's bias against its inclusion.

The Split U is not a non-free image it seems, and its inclusion in the athletics section concerns the fact that it was originally just the athletic logo.— (竜龙) """,0

 Apology to Jeremy 

Hi Jeremy,
Recently I made some rather derogatory remarks referring explicity to your homosexuality, sexual activity with those of the same gender, your race, the objects that you may or may not insert into your bodily cavity, and your inability to perform the act of fellatio at a satisfactory level. I also made some comments demanding that you orally consume my feces, and then perform fellatio, at an unsatisfactory level, to even myself. The list continues, of course, on and on and on. I also failed ot cite any source giving proof of your behaviour, and for that I am ashamed. 
So I am extending my apology to you for my explicit and coarse language, and next time I have any conflcit with you, I will definitely go abuot it in a more productive manner. I will not call you demeaning names like """"faggot, nigger, kike, cocksucker, faggot, asshole, son fo a bitch, faggot, motherfucker etc"""".
I am sincerely embarassed of my behaviour, and after reflecting I know the inappropriateness of it all. Please accept my apology, and know that whatever your lifestyle, I did not mean for my comments to be taken personally.
Sincerely,

In the serie shown as she is an amazing woman and how she began her extraordinary career, her struggle against racism and his triumph by winning as a woman in a musical world where only men was excelled, in the series is also shows how she begins conquering the world with his unique style and powerful voice, reasons that becomes her the legitimate icon of Latinos Worldwide.

If his newspaper column was syndicated to 100 newspapers, as the person (Wildhartlivie) claimed, that's leaving out many cities and towns.  I checked all three of the newspapers that existed in Washington, DC at the time Karyn died, and none of them carried """"Kup's column.""""  People in DC couldn't watch his TV talk show, either.  It wasn't listed in the local TV guide.  If a """"celebrity"""" wasn't in Washington, DC in 1963, then he/she wasn't in a lot of places.  Same goes for Raleigh, North Carolina.  I checked the News & Observer in 1963.  No Kup's column.  Other good sources are people who were over the age of 18 living in DC and Raleigh in 1963.

 Role in Russian civil war 

That section states the Bolsheviks won that war in the late 1919. That is completely wrong by any historic books and textbooks. Officially the war ended in 1922, but there was still fighting going on in the Russian Far East. That is what the Soviet historical textbooks say. For some reason the war with the Ukraine is being perceived as the Civil war in Soviet times and it seems that the same trend exist today as well. That is also wrong. Ukraine was a recognized state by the Soviet Russia as well as by the other numerous countries. That was a straight aggresion against the Ukrainian republic, following an unbelievable slaughtering of population in Ukraine by bolsheviks (Kyiv and Podillia still remembered). In 1920 Ukraine united with Poland to stop the bolshevik bandits. The Soviet textbooks state that it was an intervention of the """"White"""" Polish burgouis, relating it to the Russian white movement which is way off. 

Not on the subject of the section, but Stalin should be recognized as the enemy of the world and, at least, should be on the same page with Adolf Hitler. Stalin was way more evil. Not all of his wrongdoings are uncovered, but the one that already are known can easily convict the guy. His name should be cursed for the eternity and humanity needs to learn to avoid the next Stalin.   

Define """"convict."""" What exactly is Stalin guilty of? Killing off men and women that he believed threatened the unity and safety of his nation? Knights did that all the time. Under Stalin, the Soviet Union became incredibly well-developed, albeit uncaring towards others. They even beat us in the space race. I'm sure all of our wonderful presidents would have thought that would happen with the amazing ideals of wonderful democracy. Luna RainHowLCry

 Gregory Gilligan Rust (Reporter) 

Greg Rust (born 19 July 1970 in Sydney) is an Australian Formula One expert and commentator with Network Ten, a commercial TV network. He has also worked for the Nine Network and the Special Broadcasting Service (SBS) as a freelance commentator/reporter/presenter, mainly covering motorsport (auto racing).  Colleagues and fans call him """"Rusty"""" or """"Thruster"""" (a nickname given to him by the late Barry Sheene a former World Motorcycle Champion).
 Radio career 

Worked for 3 years with the Macquarie Radio Network  stations 2GB and 2CH in Sydney initially as a sport reporter and later became daytime news reader.

 Television career 

After cutting his teeth with SBS motorsport program Speedweek, Rust was drafted into Channel 9's commentary team for the final Australian Motorcycle Grand Prix at the Eastern Creek Raceway in 1996. He called the support races with 1980 F1 World Champ Alan Jones. In 1997 he was hired by Ten to host the Australian Super Touring Championship for 2-litre Touring Cars - a position previously held by his close friend Leigh Diffey who had moved on to Network Ten's V8 Supercar coverage.  Rust commentated the Aust. Super Touring Championship for 2 years before starting work as V8 pit reporter late in '98. He was a part of Ten's V8 coverage for almost 10 years - even hosting and anchoring the commentary on occasions.  During this period the station won numerous Logie Awards for its broadcast of the famous Bathurst 1000 and Rusty developed a reputation as a pit specialist also working on the Gold Coast Champ Car race and the Australian Formula One Grand Prix in Melbourne. Despite an offer to join the Seven Network in 2007, Rust stayed with Ten to front the station's MotoGP and F1 broadcasts and its long running magazine motorsport show RPM.  He also hosts and commentates Ten's coverage of the Red Bull Air Race series.

 Racing background 

Born into a family with a genuine love for all forms of motorsport, he was a regular at the Sydney Showground Speedway before he could even walk   and an amateur racer who started out in Karts.  In his late teens and early 20’s, Rust enjoyed some class wins as a driver in rallysprints and khana-crosses.  He has also driven V8 Supercars, Formula Holden, Formula Ford, Toyota Racing Series and Speedcars/Midgets for story research.

The discussion so far has spectacularly failed to intelligently engage the core issues or consider the significant areas Wikipedia fails in protecting companies from harm (you FAQ being a case in point; it focuses on the, important, negative aspects of paid advocacy - but doesn't contain any helpful self-criticism). Then I tried to engage the paid advocates, but your Bright Line comments appear to have alienated most of those from being interested in dialogue. So I keep doing my bit on the sidelines addressing actual content issues; it's not glamorous but it at least picks away at the core matter. What upsets me most is that you seem to be casting my viewpoint (that a bright line is impractical and wouldn't change much, that we don't handle issues with company articles well at all, that being paid to write about something doesn't mean you can't ever be objective) as """"ErrantX thinks the community wants paid advocates to be able to advocate on Wikipedia"""".

GITHUB is the top place where new computer projects are created and discussed by computer programmers. Anything that isn't right gets corrected pretty fast. For over two years the PyPrimes speed test which is open source has had not one person question the results and since it is open source anyone can download the core of Python a major new computer language and run PyPrimes and test all the various prime algorithms. Every algorithm lost to the ancient sieve of Eratosthenes, every one but Prime Spirals.

Now, outside of that real world test, the average mathematician or computer programmer is pretty much clueless as to primes and how they really interact in the modern world today (ie. Cryptology).

Now I could have used a ton of links to NPOV and alternative sites where for 20 years you have various groups arguing what this new algorithm means for the world. In fact much of the original argument was erased from Usenet in the 1990's, and the only group that could have done that was the NSA. 

Since the original algorithm was released when the NSA still controlled encryption related publishing (original paper was 1995) NO PUBLISHING COMPANY would have touched anything claiming to be how this algorithm made all encryption OBSOLETE, that was the original paper, saying to the world in 1995, here world, here is where every prime number above 5 MUST BE, there are only 8 Prime Spirals, now your whole concept of encryption has been DESTROYED by this work.

So, this prime algorthm was tied to national security issues in 1995, and in 1995 the NSA had a headlock on all academic publishing and guess what they still do today, who funds the AMS and the top journals? THE NSA

Now my original article didn't go this deep into why in 1995, this work could not be published in academia due to the NSA chokehold on academic publishing for anything that could possibly be used to create new encryption or damage old encryption.

Now 99.99% of the world is clueless that PRIMES are a big deal in crypto.

A HUGE DEAL

So understanding where they all exist and on what spirals they exist, you can now do neat tricks, like create huge seed keys for ECC crypto that gives the person that creates such a seed key a backdoor to that crypto, oh no, now we're talking about the heart of the issue WIKI LEAKS is all about crypto and how the NSA has a special skeleton key to the seed keys released by NSA projects like NIST and ENISA (europes equivalent).

Now in 1995 to 1999 or so this was discussed in many thousands of pages all over usenet, try to find them now, most are gone, now I actually participated in that era in some usenet discussions about the ENNISA paper, you cannot find one thread now mentioning ENNISA from the 1990's.

So erased all the discussion in math and physics groups about ENNISA?

Yet, if you really know where to look, you can find some references to the work, not ENNISA but the person's name and some of the the actual math still exists.

Now, the math is in books, who published the books, the guy that released it has his own publishing company and it was done via ebooks.

So I have a copy of the ebook. I know it's real.

Now today you have academics taking credit for bits and pieces of his work, and they are 100% controlled sock puppets of the NSA.

So the NSA is now controlling what the public learns about this discovery 20 years after the fact it was released via usenet.

One of the new algorithms is the Atkin sieve, look who published it with Atkin, the guy that sued the US Government in the 1990's to allow software to be published without interference of the NSA.

Look at the guys wiki page, he was tutored by the guy that actually created ECC, the stuff the NSA is using to backdoor all encryption today.

So 1995, the guy is suing the US Gov and 10 years later he is at AMS as the co-author of one of the 3 prime algorithms discussed in ENNISA in 1995.

Just google NSA and AMS, see all the NSA funding.

Just like when academics rebelled in the 1980's against the stranglehold the NSA had on crypto, guess what the NSA did, they bought out all of academia with grants.

Now I'm not a tin foil hat guy/girl, I'm retired, I was in academia and I can actually discuss stuff about math and how academia works and how various topics were taboo in the 1970's through the 1990's.

So AMS MAA AMA, etc, all are now in bed with grants and funding from the NSA.

You look at sieve of Atkin and who is on the paper the kid that sued the government over crypto software in the 1990's, who was groomed by the daddy of ECC now the top crypto used",0

 The Microsoft-Novell agreement is completely irrelevant, because (1) Microsoft owns just two of the 125 patents in the VC-1 licensing pool, and is not in a position to license the other 123 to Novell, Linux or anyone else; and (2) Novell is not Linux. It is one of hundreds of companies that work in whole or in part in the Linux arena. None of the others benefit in any way from the agreement. On the contrary, the agreement is generally being interpreted by the Linux community as a threat.
 Ffmpeg stuff is legally dodgy in the USA because that jurisdiction has software patents.
 SVG/XAML: AIUI the gist of the criticism from the sources cited is that (1) Microsoft has chosen to implement SVG-type functionality within XAML/Silverlight rather than as generic SVG within Internet Explorer. (IE is the only major browser that lacks SVG. This has rendered a useful W3C open standard largely unusable.) (2) XAML is itself a standards-buster, because it mimics W3C stuff (e.g. bits of CSS2) in an incompatible way.",0

There is a difference between Pink Floyd the band (which this page is about) and Pink Floyd the corporation. As Far as Pink Floyd the band is concerned, Roger Waters has not been a member since 1985. A member of a band is someone who plays in the band. Further, Roger Waters has no rights to any of the new music/albums that have come out since he left. i.e. Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell. Once again showing that he is no longer a member. Finally, Pink Floyd does not need permission from Roger Waters to release albums such as Pulse. He does get paid royalties, but that is it. Further, I fail to see how you could list """"The estate of Richard Wright"""" as a member of a band. Does the estate play the piano? No. It receives royalties for sure, but that doesn't make it a band member, it makes it a corporate member. I agree with Radiopathy that they should all be listed under former members. This is inline with the template on Wikipedia for musical artists. I would challenge anyone to find a Wikipedia page on a band that lists members who are no longer active as """"members"""" and not """"former members"""". I would also challenge you to find a band (other than the beatles, which I agree I don't like that format) that is inactive that doesn't list it's members as """"former members"""". Perhaps a good comparison would be the band Genesis. On their page only Phil Collins, Tony Banks, and and Mike Rutherford are listed, even though Peter Gabriel still own rights to aspects of the band like Roger Waters does to Pink Floyd. Also, INXS does not list Michael Hutchence as a member. Why? Because he's deceased, as it clearly states on the page. I'm sure his estate receives royalty payments. I would argue that the problem we are having is that some folks are simply unwilling to acknowledge the fact that Pink Floyd exists without Roger Waters, but I could be wrong. What's frustrating is to see that this article, which was once a featured article, deviates from the norm in more than one respect in regards to this section. 1 - it lists current members of a band that is inactive (I'd be willing to have that discussion), and 2 - even if we determine that the band is active, it lists a member who is no longer playing witht the band, and a member who is deceased. Proper form would dictate that neither of these persons should be listed.  """,0

 European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) Decision On The 1915 Armenian Event

On 17 December 2013, (the case: Perinçek v. Switzerland (application no. 27510/08)) European Court of Human Rights (ECHR) punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide. Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""". ECHR punished Switzerland for violating Perinçek's right of freedom of expression (Article 10). ECHR referenced three decisions on its verdict: 
a. In November 2007, The Spanish Constitutional Court had found unconstitutional the offence of negation and had taken the view that
the mere negation of a crime of genocide did not constitute direct incitement to violence. 
b. In February 2012, the French Constitutional Council had declared unconstitutional a law which made it a criminal offence to deny the existence of the genocides recognised by the law, finding it to be incompatible with freedom of expression and freedom of research. 
c. The United Nations Human Rights Committee had expressed its conviction that “[l]aws that penalize[d] the expression of opinions about historical facts [were] incompatible with the obligations that the Covenant [on Civil and Political Rights] impose[d] on States parties ...” and that the “Covenant [did] not permit general prohibition of expressions of an erroneous opinion or an incorrect interpretation of past events”.ECHR ECHR punished Switzerland for criminally convicting Mr. Perinçek for publicly challenging the existence of the Armenian genocide (Perinçek said """"Armenian genocide is an international lie"""").

I hope now that the researchers can freely and without any fear research what happened in 1915.
Notice that in 2013 ALL Ottoman Empire archieves are open to the researchers and any researcher can freely read ALL the archieves and documents in Turkey.
However, Armenia still does not allow its archieves to be searched and reserached. 212.174.38.3

129605,b54c9836601eb78a,"""Kurt and Dave get it on?==

Groaning Kurt released his cock. For the past week he hadn't been able to get off. He tried a cocktail of drugs and a cocktail of whores. Nothing was doing it for him. Masturbating in the shower wasn't even working. Oh he was getting hard all right, he just couldn't fucking cum. And it was driving him nuts.

To top it off, he didn't know why he couldn't cum. The girls had been either hot enough or slutty enough. Even the couple of guys he brought home had been decent. Despite that, he couldn't fucking cum. And a week of that was enough to make anyone more pissy than normal.

Which meant band practice was unlikely to be much fun for anyone.

That was made abundantly clear the moment Kurt stepped into the rehearsal studio. His eyes flicked from Krist to Dave and he came to a sudden stop. Dave was sitting on a couch, a pretty girl in his lap giggling. It was like he was taunting Kurt. And he would have nothing of that.

Stalking over to the drummer and the floozie, Kurt pulled her forcibly out of his lap. The girl squealed and Dave growled, but Kurt paid no attention, forcing the girl out of the studio. After slamming the door he headed back over to Dave. Without a word he pulled the drummer to him and kissed him possessively.

Dave shoved Kurt away, """"What part of no don't you fucking understand!?""""

Krist's eyes widened and he took a step forward, """"Guys, I think—""""

Kurt sent him a silent glare, silencing and stopping him.

""""I don't want you, Kurt. I don't even fucking like you right now,"""" Dave growled. """"In fact, I fucking quit! I don't have to put up with this shit. You're fucking insane. You need some other crackwhore to take my place. I'm not it.""""

Sidestepping the singer, Dave headed towards the door. He barely made three steps before Kurt grabbed him again. This time his back was pulled to Kurt's front. He could clearly feel the singer's erection pressing into his ass.

He wasn't going to be anyone's bitch.

""""I'm just gonna... go,"""" Krist muttered before slipping out of the room quickly.

""""You're fucking mine, Dave,"""" Kurt declared, licking Dave's neck. """"Always.""""

For as small as he was, Kurt had more strength than Dave expected. With considerably less effort than he would have figured, the singer forced the drummer down to the floor. Dave wiggled and tried to crawl away, but all that resulted was in Kurt pulling the drummer's pants off.

Laying down on top of Dave while he worked his own pants off, Kurt hissed in his ear, """"You're mine. You hear me? Fucking mine.""""

""""Stop! Kurt, stop!"""" Dave struggled.

With Kurt's weight on him, the drummer had very little maneuverability. He was completely trapped. But that didn't mean he stopped trying to get away. While wholly his struggling was probably a good thing, it wasn't really helping. If anything it was turning Kurt on more.

Not having the patience to remove Dave's boxers, Kurt reached down and tore the back seam, exposing the drummer's ass. He didn't even pause to warn Dave. His hands spread Dave's cheeks, spit down his crack to provide some lubrication, and quickly pushed his cock in. Dave screamed, wiggling once more to get away. With Kurt's hands holding onto his hips, he had no chance to go anywhere, at least not until the singer was done.

Dave's screams faded into sobs. That alone drove Kurt further, faster. He loved everything about it. The way Dave's ass squeezed his cock better than anyone else's had before. He was a perfect glove, a perfect fit. Before too long a week's worth of unreleased cum spurted from Kurt's cock.

Slowly he pulled out, not really caring about the mixture of blood and semen leaking from Dave's ass. Grinning to himself he refastened his pants. He glanced at Dave, a feeling of superiority infusing him. He totally owned Dave now. 

Does anyone have any basis for this rumour? I would love to put it on the main page.

 Kindly please stop lying if you wish me to stop pointing out your lies. It's very rude and disrespectful when I spend my time citing verifiable and reliable sources and you just lie outright, nevermind content, but even on just simply what's happening here, and here's an example of just how you just now did it before requesting that I stop calling you """"liars""""; from Wikipedia:Wikiquette_alerts#December_8, I quote your statement and my reply to it:

 QUOTED: """"I hope that now since all editors have reached a consensus on the article, and have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system, you would play a more constructive role. Thanks.   

 QUOTED: Why are you lying again here? yes, lying! As you had been doing for quite some time now and as I have pointed out. The dictionary defines a lie as """"1. A false statement deliberately presented as being true; a falsehood. 2. Something meant to deceive or give a wrong impression."""" First of all, """"all editors have reached a consensus on the article"""" is a demonstrable false statement that you should know is not true and that we're having this exchange here is evidence enough that it isn't, nevermind others. Second, here's your other BIG lie, you say others """"have tried to explain you in clearest possible words the difference between numeral symbols and numeral system"""", Oh really? why don't you tell everyone here that it is I who made the clearest distinction and as far as I remember and see on the page I was the first to make it between numeral symbols and numeral system, and you should know because you have been around. I clearly distinguished in my first post between the Arabic Numerals (1, 2, 3, 4...) and the Hindu-Arabic Numeral system in a paraphragh that begins with """"- For a start,"""" Talk:History_of_Indian_and_Arabic_numerals#RFC_2 and you should especially know, not just because youhave been around, but also because what you quoted above happens to be just the paragraph under it!

Some of these uploads are music, some are comedy, some are anti BNP/EDL. None are espousing a particular movement, political group or ideology. However, due to the fact that I espouse equality and fairness & am opposed to unwarranted victimisation, oppression of minorities, hatred and ignorance it seems that certain users like to think of it as a soapbox to spew their racist, misogynistic, homophobic, xenophobic and hate-filled gibberish....the BNPers, of course, are guilty of all the aforementioned.

Apparently my decision not to allow comments that are basically spam, lazy insults, illiterate ramblings and screeching from morons who don't listen (but just use the channel as their own forum) means I am anti free speech. I don't think our ancestors fought against fascism and for the right for freedom of speech to have hate-filled knuckle draggers abuse that by screeching hate-filled drivel bereft of facts, decency or, indeed, a point.

I do actively encourage freedom of speech for all, quite often letting idiots speak makes them look far more idiotic than I ever could hope. There is a difference between debate and spamming, insulting, not listening and preaching though.

I'm happy to debate, but a debate consists of two sides discussing their views, not one shouting and refusing to listen to anyone else. It is my channel and I have the right not to allow trolls, clones, neo Nazis, racists, haters and all round ne'er do wells the right to puke bile all over it....this is not suppression of freedom of speech and if anyone cares to look back through my channel they will see I actively encourage debate, but also see how so many choose to eschew debate in favour of:
1. Attempting to belittle, hurl abuse and calling me UAF/Marxist/far left/rapist/paedophile with absolutely no basis (libelous in reality).
2. Personal insults, accusing me of being a foreigner, bringing my family into it (they love a """"mum"""" insult) and accusing me of being several users because they can't believe more than one person can disagree.
3. Misquoting, paraphrasing and cherry picking """"research"""" from questionable sources and only ever """"research"""" or accept sources that back up their own beliefs.
4. Lying, accusing me of acts I haven't done and claiming they have """"won"""" the argument when they have ignored the points I raised and just harped on and on.
5. Cloning my account on here and also using my username on far right forums. They have cloned me numerous times.
6. Waffling on about being deprived of freedom of speech (to make insults and allow no right to reply by blocking me from their channels)

Basically, these goons make up a tiny minority of incredibly arrogant, ignorant, spiteful, indecent, amoral, borderline illiterate joy sappers; BNP, EDL, neo Nazis, Islamophobes, extremists, KKK, you name it. THEY are what is wrong with the world and they are what is trying to stop us evolving; their motivation is hatred and ignorance....proven by their labelling of everyone who disagrees with them as communists, UAF, Marxists and Liberals (and more unbelievably fascists?!?) with no basis. Of course, they are just lazy epithets to group the majority into one category when their opposition is made up of a multitude of individuals from left to right, of different coloured skin and beliefs, sexualities, classes, background etc....the majority basically.

Youtube grants these guttersnipes the anonymity to parade their ignorance and disgusting ideals and appear to be a larger group than they are. They are fooling themselves though, they will always be a minority of failures who blame their own failure in life on everyone but themselves. Ironically, our ancestors who fought for every freedom they treasure now are having it spat back in their face with every ill informed, erroneous, indecent and anti educational rant these idiots post.

I encourage debate, NOT bickering, childish playground taunts or interminable clowns on their soapbox refusing to listen to others. It is still possible to get a viewpoint across without resorting to actions a 5 year old would sneer at.

These types are incredibly easy to expose for what they are, they do half the job themselves and not one of them has yet """"defeated"""" me or shut me up. Not only do I have the majority on my side but also facts and common sense.....they have none of this. I don't proclaim to be intelligent, but I certainly have the majority of int",1

 Crocus olivieri istanbulensis 

Dear Rivertorch,

This taxon is one on the three subspecies of Crocus olivieri.
Its correct name is Crocus olivieri Gray subsp. istanbulensis B. Mathew. I have corrected it. 

I hope the anonymous user will not change it again.

Best regards,  (To reply) 

Hi Réginald. If you hadn't arrived on the scene, I was going to ping you. I removed the Turkish image and link, since I didn't think they were germane, but I left it to you to fix the taxonomic details. Does Mathew's classification, as it appears in the article, contain all the known species of crocus?   

Hi River,
The page contains all the recorded species, but not the infraspecific taxa (i.e., the numerous subspecies). Originally Crocus olivieri subsp. istanbulensis was for this reason not included. For consistency reason including it required to mention also -as I did- the two other subspecies olivieri and balansae.
The issue is: if we want to be fully consistent we have to mention also all recorded subspecies (with their distribution as for that of C. olivieri?), among others the numerous subspecies of the variable C. biflorus. A niggling work! I am afraid that the page will become too scholastic.
Your advice about this issue?
Best regards,  (To reply) 
PS: You can find a quite complete list of species and their subspecies on the NCBI taxonomy browser. Type """"Crocus"""" in the """"search for"""" bar.  (To reply) 

Thanks for the link—that's a great resource. I don't think we should worry about its being too scholastic. My main concern would be with consistency: I'm not sure if there are comparable articles that also list all subspecies. The information about subspecies certainly should be available on Wikipedia, but should it go in the main article or in the more specific articles about each species (of which there are now only a few). I don't know.   
For consistency reasons I have added the other subspecies reported in the NCBI taxonomy and cited the source. I agree that additional paragraphs or articles should be written for the most representative species, in which a detailed description of their subspecies would then be done (as e.g. I have done in fr:Crocus).  (To reply) 
Okay. I'd be happy to help with creating new articles and refining translations, if you want to go that route. Just remember I don't know what I'm talking about ;-)    

Dear River,
I have removed again the the logo of the Sultanbeyli District Municipality, that User:Terzinator had added again to Crocus, explaining the reason for doing it (see User talk:Terzinator). Hopefully, he/she will not add it again!
Best regards,  (To reply) 
Thanks, Réginald. I don't do edit wars, so I'm glad there's someone else diligently watching the page. I see that the image appears to lack any copyright info or fair-use claims. I try to avoid any involvement with enforcement of image policies, but if it gets added again I will see if it can be deleted on those grounds.

 UNBLOCK ME YOU ASSHOES! 

{{unblock|HAHAHAHA!!!

One of my favorite and most vivid memories was of a party I attended in high school. It was near the end of the year, and everyone was letting loose. The party had not gotten too badly out of control, and was finally winding down.

I was dating Karen at the time. We'd been going out for about six months. We knew our time together was growing short since we'd soon be heading off to college, she to Radcliffe, and I to Johns Hopkins. We were taking every chance we could to be intimate. I'd been with a few girls before, but Karen had been my first long term intimate relationship, and we'd taught each other lots.

The party was at Keith's house and we were helping him clean up. There were only six of us left, Karen and I, Keith, his girlfriend Linda, Tom and his girlfriend Sue. Linda lived just a few doors down and had invited Karen and Sue to spend the night. Tom was going to spend the night at Keith's house. Conveniently, Linda's parents were out of town until tomorrow noon, so nobody really had anywhere they had to go, and once we'd done a fair job of cleaning up we are able to sit back and relax.

Keith was my best friend. We had a lot in common, even if we were a bit of a """"Mutt and Jeff"""" in appearance. Both of us tall, I had a wide body, result of my Hawaiian ancestry, while he was lean and blonde. I'm 6'1"""" but he had a good 2 inches on me, and had long hair past his shoulders. Mine is brown and curly, and usually just goes whereever it wants. I'm strong as an ox, he's lean and fast. But we had similar taste in women. On more than one occasion I teased him that there was no way he deserved to be with Linda, our high-school goddess, and he was extremely envious that I had Karen, our big-breasted sexy bombshell, as my partner.

Karen and Sue were close friends. If we'd had Diana here, the triumvirate would have been complete. They had all been innocents until that year. Diana was dating, and Karen told me that she and Ryan were 'almost there', doing everything except the final act. Karen hadn't done much of anything until we'd gotten together. But we didn't let grass grow under us, and we made up for a lot of lost time. We'd had sex plenty, and she'd sucked me off more times than I can count. I'd even fucked her incredible tits a couple of times. Sue, it turns out, was the late bloomer. She was still an innocent according to Karen. Kissing was as far as she'd gone, although it seems she'd rubbed Tom's dick through his pants, and he'd had his hands on her mound, even if the underwear was still in the way. But Karen was hinting that this party might be Tom's lucky night.

We were joking about some of the antics that had been going on at the party. Linda in particular was a lurker; she'd sit back and watch all the activities at the party and was always good for a few laughs.

""""There were some really desperate people here tonight,"""" she said. """"Can you believe Gary tried to get a game of Spin the Bottle going?""""

""""I can't say I really blame him,"""" I answered with a grin. """"Not every guy there is as fortunate as us to have such gorgeous girlfriends, or any girlfriend for that matter. Hell, I wouldn'd mind playing it now!"""" That earned me a poke in the ribs from Karen.

Sue chimed in, """"Why is it that every party ends up with some lame guy trying to start some stupid game like Spin the Bottle, Post Office, or Strip Poker?""""

""""Now that's a stupid question,"""" Keith answered.

""""And why is that?"""" Linda asked, pointedly.

""""Isn't it obvious?"""" Keith replied.

""""No."""" Linda and Sue answered in unison.

""""Do you want to tell them?"""" Keith asked me with a nod.

So I explained the obvious. """"Because they ARE desperate - and sometimes it works.""""

""""Oh please!"""" Karen said.

Keith was a real instigator. """"You guys have never played Spin the Bottle?""""

The girls looked at each other. """"Maybe a few times, but certainly not in the last year."""" Linda finally answered.

""""And how about Truth or Dare?"""" Keith continued egging them on.

""""Well sure, but usually only with people we know really well,"""" Karen answered this time.

""""Usually."""" Keith echoed with a grin. """"And it's not like you've never played Strip Poker.""""

The girls looked at each other quietly no one answering.

""""Oh come on,"""" I teased, """"Karen I know you've played Strip Poker.""""

""""Not really. I watched part of a game, but then they chased everyone not playing out of the room. Why? I suppose you've played it?"""" She asked with a dangerous tone in her voice.

""""Sort of. In camp we started a game but it got raided before we got anywhere."""" I confessed, drawing a laugh from the guys. """"L",1

The trouble is that that version was hype too. Wikipedia is not a press coverage scrapbook (WP:LINKFARM) - I realise it was put in to peacock Ethereum for the AFD (which is why it looked so artificial), but the point stands that if those articles are worth including, they need to actually be used as references.
I note also the heading is """"reception"""" - none of it is talking about how Ethereum has been received, it's just a list of press clippings. From e.g. the version before I touched it, there's two statements from non-SP-notable people and one from someone notable enough to have a WP article who also happens to do amateur economics blogging.

Thanks for the support Grundle. No worries. I need to get some stuff done anyway. The claims of """"personal attack"""" and """"harassment"""" are bunk of course. But 2/0 has, unfortuntely (past experiences suggests he's a decent fellow) been quite active along with Jehochman in carrying out a reign of censorship against those with opinions they don't share. This abusive behavior is damaging to the encyclopedia and is anti-intellectualism of the worst kind, but not much different the Climategate nonsense we've seen. Dishonest, misleading, misinformation campaigns like these are very harmful to the pragmatic solutions to protect the environment, so it's pretty disheartening that somemthing I'm involved in, Wikipedia, is being abused to this extent. The dishonest manipulation of sources, the smearing, and the bullying cabalism are very discouraging. But the world is not a perfect place. I smiled at a few of the discussions on your page.

I have posted my comments indicating that I would be offline after them as a courtesy to others, who might wonder why I haven't replied to them quickly or might not be doing so at all.  Not everyone checks user and talk pages to see courtesy postings about online status, etc.  Sorry that you find my attempt to be courteous to other Wikipedians """"annoying"""".  In the past, you (and others) have not understand my comments (see the archives); as you (and others) seem to mistinterpret what I write and to read intentions in what I write that I do not have, I have suggested that you (and some of these others) not engage in these kinds of exchanges with me; I do not find them productive.
I am replying only out of courtesy and so that eventually this exchange can be archived by the automatic archiving bot.
There is no """"rule"""" or """"guideline"""" in Wikipedia that one must reply to every comment in one's user talk page or an article talk page.  Replying is up to one's own discretion and time constraints (""""schedule""""). There is no requirement that editors must spend their time editing Wikipedia; WP:POL states the opposite; that one should not be criticized for how one chooses to spend one's own time.  That is the prerogative of each of us.  How we express ourselves, as long as it is courteous, is also up to each of us.  If we want to take our time to criticize others, we need to keep in mind that we are doing so in public space and that our criticisms are being read by whoever logs on to that space.
From my own perspective, I find the comment posted above gratuitous and unnecessary.  Irrespective of that comment, I will continue to post what I consider a courtesy to others since that is how I intend it to be.  I do not intend to annoy anyone.  The guidelines for how to address other users are in Wikipedia:Etiquette, WP:NPA, and other places linked in WP:POL.  I try to follow these guidelines in what I post in Wikipedia. To assume otherwise is to violate WP:AGF.  I am posting this reply in good faith as well.   

To others who might be more interested than some in why I may not reply quickly or at all: I explain that in """"N.B."""", but not everyone consults a user's talk page when commenting in article talk pages, and so some may not see that explanation in """"N.B."""" above; therefore, I have mentioned that I would be offline in some of my recent comments in talk page article(s) that I have worked hard on in the past.  I will be back offline after this reply and will not see what anyone posts here until I return to check the functioning of the achiving bot (I don't know when that will be).  I have a massive amount of work to do offline over the next two weeks, which has been delayed in getting to me (thus I've been online occasionally in the past week from time to time), but I expect to be away from Wikipedia after this reply for indefinite and extended periods of time both during and after the next two weeks as well (on an extended """"wikibreak""""; please see the template notice above).

 Warning 

I am just here to say that bias you have against me is plainly obvious, and I am asking you kindly to back off, as I am starting to get annoyed. I am starting to think that you see my username and instinctively hit revert. You pretty much admitted this in your reversion of the 1965 Palm Sunday article. If you would simply do some basic fact checking, this could all be avoided

My change to """"Lacon, IL"""" was sourced via Grazulis, and you obviously reverted because you saw my username, and didn't even check or research the validity of my edit. I would bet money that if any other user made that edit, you wouldn't have reverted it. If you have this idea that I make willy-nilly edits with no basis, then you are mistaken. I dig through hours online resources, old newspaper archives, books, and pdf documents to find my information. I take pride in providing valuable, detailed, and verifiable info on historical tornadic events. Seeing the reversion of all this work is frustrating to say the least. All I ask is for you to trust me a little more, and actually READ the sources and information provided.

Yes Dalits, particularly in Uttar Pradesh (as an article AVC referred to earlier suggests), have improved economically over the last six decades, specially after the economic liberalization. But if we add that data in the society section, the article will appear defensive and awkward. However, I have a problem with the wording of the proposal as it stands now. Adding especially in rural areas implies that Dalits are facing segregation and persecution in urban areas as well even if to a lesser extent. Can we just go with most Dalits (""""ex–Untouchables"""") and other low castes in rural areas...? «৳alk» """,0

I think you are doing a lousy job polluting valid information with complete garbage.

This personage, it is stated, had two sons, Muirich Mhor and Dhai Dhu. From the former of these was descended Clan Mhuirich or Macpherson, and from the latter Clan Dhai or Davidson. Sir Aeneas Macpherson, the historian of the clan of that name, states that both the Macphersons and the Davidsons were descended from Muirich, parson of Kingussie in the twelfth century. You suck, and this site sucks and your edits are complete crap but I'm sure you feel justified somehow in your pathetic view.

Thanks for the message.
I have only altered music data which I'm 100% sure of, such as Roy Orbison pages, etc.  I've been collecting music data since July 1960, therefore have a high degree of knowledge where music is concerned.

Someone has mentioned to me a person with the sirname 'Derbyshire'.  I don't know anyone with the last name 'Derbyshire'.

I contributed to the Guiness Book of British Hit Singles and Albums for many years {you'll find my name - Russtti Gaynor - listed in many of the final copies, until Virgin took over in 2006.

First of all, you don't know crap about Vietnam.

Secondly, of course many (actual) rebels were local residents, i.e. of KBR. But as of the bodies, some/most of them belonged to innocent civilians who were killed in crossfire (like even the KBR president said). Here's about the mechanism of this:

""""This is a commonplace in Chechnya. I have not been to Nalchik and I do not know this case, but it is quite possible that such things happen there too. Well, basically, they happen throughout entire Russia, only specifics are different — drugs or weapons are planted in order to jail one or get paid for closing a case,"""" an officer of the Department for the Combating of Organised Crime and Terrorism of the Russian Internal Affairs Ministry told Caucasian Knot's correspondent. """"Of course, civilians sometimes die in Chechnya and in other North Caucasus republics, too, where counter-terrorist activities are conducted, and weapons are planted on them by officers that are not the most conscientious. But one should understand that they do so not because they want to register another victory for themselves, but for fear that they can be jailed for good because of this accidental killing."""" According to the officer, one should not say that """"someone is killed on purpose and then registered as a rebel. Only Kadyrovtsy do so. It is not a custom among us, federals.""""

And actually indeed some time later a group of Kadyrov's policemen (called """"a gang"""") were persecuted precisely for this, that is killing random people (few men and a woman they kidnapped and killed) and then planting guns and explosives on them for promotions. But of course, there was also the case of Vladimir Glebov, etc.

 Goalie stats 

Template:Infobox football biography 2 states quite clearly that the """"(Gls)"""" stands for goals that the player has been awarded in league competition only for each professional club. There are goalies with quite a substantial number of goals, for example Hans-Jörg Butt, so the numbers are not always zero. 

There are no different infoboxes for goalkeepers and other players and the consensus at WP:FOOTY is (as far as I know) to treat them in the same way.

OK, no reordering. But can we give them designations, like this? I'm calling it """"List A"""" so we can start a new list later without confusion. If you don't like it we'll work something else out, but we really need some way to refer to issues without saying, """"Hey, getting back to that thing we were talking about, the bit where it says that Gage was traveling, not the bit about the time when he blah blah blah.""""

One point: we absolutely cannot refer to """"Note X"""" and """"Ref 22"""" and so on. These designations shift around as the article is edited and we will go completely crazy. In the below, I've substituted permalinks instead. 

Issues list """"A""""

A1 Background
A1a """"He may have gained skill with explosives on his family's farms or in nearby mines and quarries..."""" Speculation from Macmillan. Attribute it.
A1b Gage's date of birth in the infobox is not covered here when it should be covered and noted in proper context of its sourcing.

A2 Gage's accident
A2a Does not address numerous theories presented or Gage's actions prior to accident. EEng knows all too well this subject. I think Ratiu and Van Horn's material needs to be pointed out because the evidence shows that Gage had his mouth open and was speaking at the time the rod passed through his skull. I do not know why this is absent. I have issues with the section, but I'll hold off on the excessive quoting and measurement issues for now.

A3 Subsequent life and travels
A3a """"bt. February he was able to do a little work abt. ye horses & barn, feedg. ye cattle &c; that as ye time for ploughing came he was able to do half a days work after that & bore it well."""" - Paraphrase.
A3b  Would Gage's mental impairment belong here? I think it would be helpful.
A3c  Missing Gage's time in New Hampshire prior to Chile.
A3d  Chile and California is missing the account of Gage's doctor and missing some other tidbits, not too bad - but everything related to his mental improvement and the regaining of normalcy in his life is absent without reason.
A3e This is also the key section that Macmillan's research becomes quite useful as a case argument.

A4 Death and subsequent travels
A4a  Still glaringly missing the details surrounding his return home, illness and death. 
A4b Also, the exhumation details - which was in Fleischman's book - is entirely absent. This little episode in the Gage story is something which is important. 

A5 Other matters
A5a Analysis and actual examination of the claims and details surrounding Gage and his role in science has been well- mostly avoided by the article. Instead of proper detailing of the injury and Gage's role in history. 
A5b Only a few hundred words on Gage's mental impairments were written yet lengthy quotes are used.
A5c Using """"passim"""" and other issues in citing Macmillan is also a cop-out and would merit a verifiability failure.
A5d Not even that, it doesn't even credit Macmillan when it should.

A6 Notes
A6a A substantial part of the text is hidden away in these notes. These complex, rambling, and citation filled messes that only make verification more tedious.
A6b A note like  which reads """" See Macmillan & Lena;[34]:9 Harlow;[12]:332,345 Bigelow;[11]:16–17 Harlow;[9]:390 Macmillan.[1]:86"""" is just improper.
A6c  Note  - """"Macmillan's book provides one of those rare occasions on which one can truly say that further research is not necessary ... the definitive account ...""""[57]"""" - is just the type of note we do not need.

A3c For Gage's time in New Hampshire, didn't he spent 18 months in a horse stable?

The article says
Gage subsequently worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire
Harlow says this began sometime in 1851 and, """"He remained there, without any interruption from ill health, for nearly or quite a year and a half."""" This fits with JMH's (JHM = John Martyn Harlow) information that PG went to Chile in August 1852. How about if we change it to 
For about eighteen months he worked for the owner of a livery and coach service in Hanover, New Hampshire
Thoughts?   

A4a missing details surrounding return home, illness and death

""""but he was in Chile for about 7 years, correct? Then he returned and rested for awhile before becoming a farm laborer - I'm not sure if this is on one or several farms, but wasn't the convulsions following a day's labor on the farm? The seizures",0

Why Wikipedia Must Jettison Its Anti-Elitism

By lsanger in Op-Ed
Fri Dec 31, 2004 at 12:42:24 AM EST
Tags: Internet (all tags) TABInternet
TAB

Wikipedia has started to hit the big time. Accordingly, several critical articles have come out, including """"The Faith-Based Encyclopedia"""" by a former editor-in-chief of Britannica and a very widely-syndicated AP article that was given such titles as """"When Information Access Is So Easy, Truth Can Be Elusive"""".

These articles are written by people who appear not to appreciate the merits of Wikipedia fully. I do, however; I co-founded Wikipedia. (I have since left the project.)

Wikipedia does have two big problems, and attention to them is long overdue. These problems could be eliminated by eliminating a single root problem. If the project's managers are not willing to solve it, I fear a fork (a new edition under new management, for the non-techies reading this) will probably be necessary.

TAB
TAB
Let me preface this by saying that I know Wikipedia is very cool. A lot of people do not think so, but of course they are wrong. So the following must be taken in the spirit of someone who knows and supports the mission and broad policy outlines of Wikipedia very well.

First problem: lack of public perception of credibility, particularly in areas of detail. The problem I would like to point out is not that Wikipedia is unreliable. The alleged unreliability of Wikipedia is something that the above (TechCentralStation and AP) articles make much of, but that is not my point, and I am not interested in discussing that point per se.

My point is that, regardless of whether Wikipedia actually is more or less reliable than the average encyclopedia, it is not perceived as adequately reliable by many librarians, teachers, and academics. The reason for this is not far to seek: those librarians etc. note that anybody can contribute and that there are no traditional review processes. You might hasten to reply that it does work nonetheless, and I would agree with you to a large extent, but your assurances will not put this concern to rest.

You might maintain that people are already using Wikipedia a lot, and that that implies a great deal of trust. This is true, as far as it goes; but people use many sources that they themselves believe to be unreliable, via Google searches, for example. (I do so all the time, though perhaps I shouldn't.) Perhaps Wikipedia is better described as one of those sources regarded as unreliable which people read anyway. And in this case, one might say, there's no problem: Wikipedia is being read, and it is of minimally adequate and increasing reliability. What more could you ask? In other words, why does a perception of unreliability matter?

I am willing to grant much of this reply. I think merely that there are a great many benefits that accrue from robust credibility to the public. One benefit, but only one, is support and participation by academia. I am on the academic job market now and I felt it was necessary to explain my views about Wikipedia's credibility for potential employers. A great many of my colleagues are not at all impressed with the project; but more about that in a bit.

Another benefit accruing from robust public credibility is even more widespread use and support by teachers, schools, libraries, and the general publicprecisely the people who want to use what they believe to be a credible encyclopedia. To the extent that the project is not reaching, and being supported by, these people, it is not succeeding as well as it might.

Perhaps you might also maintain that, while Wikipedia does not now have a reputation for reliability, it will eventually, once enough studies proving its reliability are done, and once people are more familiar with the concept behind the project. This is hard to argue with; but it is also hard to support, because it involves predicting the future, and the future, when it comes to public opinion, is extremely unpredictable. It would be better to do something to help guarantee a reputation for reliability.

Wikipedia has another sort of credibility problem, mentioned in passing above, and I fear that time is not a solution to this problem, the way it might be to the foregoing one. Namely, one can make a good case that, when it comes to relatively specialized topics (outside of the interests of most of the contributors), the project's credibility is very uneven. If the project was lucky enough to have a writer or two well-informed about some specialized subject, and if their work was not degraded in quality by the majority of people, whose knowledge of the subject is based on paragraphs in books and mere mentions in college class",0

23740,3eb4ba8f04bd4c5d,"""::No, the only problem here is your attitude. You need to calm down and argue your case for exclusing criticism of Blitzer and details of his bibliography/relationship with AIPAC from a rational standpoint. You also need to argue for these exclusions on a policy basis. Characterizing the statements of 2 critics, people as liable for court proceedings as wikipedia, """"tangential"""", is no good. He worked for AIPAC. Evidence reflected in his published work for AIPAC also exists. Attempting to disallow inclusion of criticism because you havent found """"the other side"""" is no good either. That he made a rebuttal was originally mentioned by me. I spent time looking for his rebuttal, please include it if you have more luck finding it.
I did find published evidence of Blitzer working for AIPAC. You must move on to trying to discredit that evidence. Yes getting the name of the paper wrong was a silly mistake but doesnt reflect on the cited sources, or details of Blitzers work for AIPAC.

 Dubious claims about clearly non-transgenderd people 

This article lists a whole bunch of people whos transgender status is clearly wrong and others for whom it is highly speculative.  This isn't a list of people who """"kinda, sorta, there's a small chance, maybe"""" are transgender.

The ones who cross-dressed for some nefarious/deceptive purpose and not as a life style choice clearly can not be classified as transgender and should be removed from the article completely.  The fact that mythological figures such as Achilles were even added in the first place says a lot about the POV pushing of the people who supported it.  The only mythological one who might be considered transgenderes is Guan Yin.  The real life figures who did it to disguise themselves to avoid something (e.g. military service) or even to get into something where women are discriminated against.  They did it for deceptive purposes as well, so they can't really be considered transgendered.

The pope one is laughable and definitely should be removed.  The one about Joan of Arc is based exclusively on an accustion from a unreliable source.  If they accused her of being a witch, should we have included her in a list of witches too?  Also, I'd like to see an authoritative source showing that she was even accused of it as it seems that it's most Wikipedia ripped sites and LGBT websites that site that as fact.

And what are """"transvestite tendencies"""" in reference to Ed Wood?  You need to start citing sources or I'm just going to start deleting them.  That goes mainly for the historical and mythological figurse section.

Maxwell Klinger wasn't even a real transvestite, he only did that so he'd get a section 8 and get kicked out of the army.  Anyone who watched the show knows he would try all kinds of crazy stuff to get kicked out under the guise of being mentally ill.  This phrase describing the character is also very odd: """"Although a transvestite, he loudly denied any charges of homosexuality.""""  What's the association between the two?

Also, it appears they're using a warped definition of transgender here.  I've never heard a definition that would automatically include cross-dressers as if that automatically means they identify with the opposite gender rather than just enjoying the clothes.  I'm sorry, but this overly broad and incorrect definition of transgender is obviously an attempt just to make the list as long as possible.

Jundullah article

I was impressed with the little physical traits of Thaw/Morse that Shaun Evans gave us. The tug of the collar etc. I also liked the fleshing out of some of the things in Morse's past that the original series had referred to over the years. I also like that we saw a young version of Max the pathologist as Peter Woodthorpe and John Thaw's interplay was a delight of the first three seasons of Morse. One question - If this is going to be the only Endeavor episode shouldn't the page be moved to take """"series"""" out of its title?

As much as PBS is a a part of my life I tired, several years ago, of how they mess with the British programs. So I bought myself a region free DVD player and have been ordering the series from Amazon UK. Amazingly the product is often cheaper - even with the shipping costs - than buying the DVDs from Amazon US and I get to see the programs before they air on PBS or BBC America - or as I know call it the Top Gear/Gordan Ramsey channel. Sherlock has been brilliant and I love the jokes about Mycroft's weight. Speaking of Mark Gatiss who would have thought that one of The League of Gentleman zanies would be doing so many interesting things today. That also means that I should mention his one time colleague Steve Pemberton's WhiteChapel series. While not necessarily up there with some of our favorites it has had some interesting moments.

The categorization is The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. Yes, members of the Church are often known as """"Mormons,"""" but that is the nickname that a lot of people call them by. The Church says that the official term for these members is """"members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.""""

Of course some people think that's rather long to say, so the church acknowledges that people will often call the members just """"Mormons."""" Nevertheless, that remains as only a nickname for the church and part of the official name of one of the books of scripture, The Book of Mormon: Another Testament of Jesus Christ, because of the prophet named Mormon who abridged the original writings. The only other official names with """"Mormon"""" in them are the book Mormon Doctrine and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. As for members themselves, reference to them as """"Mormons"""" remains only a nickname.

So you say that the official info box text is to leave it without nickname quotes. So what? Why shouldn't we ammend that official policy so that it makes room for that type of labeling? And so what if there is """"no need"""" (<- those are the """"you're saying it, not me; and not that I believe you"""" quotes right there) to change it? That doesn't mean there would be anything """"wrong"""" (as you'd probably say) with adding them, does it? They are not errant. They are not like adding an apostrophe to a word where none belongs, in an attempt to form a plural! They are good to show outsiders the difference between the official church name and the nickname. What's so """"sinister"""" about that? I say we change WP:Mormon's rule about it. Why not? Well, of course that would require a concensus, but why would people have to be so opposed to it?

What about the intro. of Donny Osmond? That uses quotation marks to set apart his nickname of """"Donny"""" from his real name, Donald Clark Osmond, in the form of """"Donald Clark 'Donny' Osmond."""" So there. Why can't the LDS church in info boxes be that same basic way (including be adjusted as WP:Mormon policy)?

Let's start over...

This is not going anywhere, except towards mediation. Though I agree more or less completely with Justin's edits, you both need to calm down. The spelling/language issue is pointless, as are the insults, as are the reverts, and the misleading and/or rude edit summaries. Who cares which version is online for two or three hours, if it's going to be reverted anyway once this debate is completed? So let's focus on the debate, and leave the page at some point where we are all familiar with the content, and then do changes step-by-step. To improve the mood here, I think Daryou should accept that there may be some spelling errors in his texts, while Koavf really needs to respect that Daryou's not a native speaker, and not harass him over this. (And I need to stop sounding like my mom.)
 Mincom, the Moroccan government's own site, is of course propaganda, by every definition of the word, but that doesn't mean it can't be used as a source - for what Morocco's government thinks and says. On the other hand, pasting hole chunks of text from it as fact, is obviously not how this should be done.
 Inserting that Western Sahara was """"peacefully ... liberated"""" by Morocco is also betraying an agenda that is far more biased than your edits have been so far, Daryou. I think you've been trying to make that point all along, consistently in all of your edits, but you used to be better at hiding it.
 Questions remain above to be answered, with arguments, not reverts or insults.
 That's my input for today, and, yes, I think mediation could be a good thing. I was hoping we could settle this one through discussion (it has worked before!), but I've lost hope by now.

There will be scheduled meetings on every Tuesday at 14:00 in room 111. All group members are required to attend these meetings. Please remember that success of group projects highly depend upon productive group meetings, so please try to make every single one of them.
 
These meetings will start from next week, 6th October Tuesday. I would be heading the first meeting as the Chairperson and Sam would be the Secretory. The post of the chairperson and secretory would keep on rotating so that everyone is involved in this group project.
 
As discussed in today's meeting there are a few tasks that need to be addressed before the meeting on Tuesday, 6th October; which are as follows:
 
    *
      Setting up a Wiki Forum to have an effective group communication system and also providing easy access to the projectmaterial to all the group members. Tejal volunteered to set up the forum. All details of it will be passed on to all of you as soonas it is finished.
    *
      Coming up with conceptual design and ideas for the payload because as we all know payload is most important driver of thesatellite design, so ideally that would be the first step in our project.
    *
      Also please note down the email IDs of all the group members for future contact. And don't forget to buy a log book foryourselves.

If you have any further queries please don't hesitate to contact me.

No point in concealing the fact that oil and gas exports and petroleum price play important role in the Russian economy. However there is no point in highlighting this fact too much since it borders with spreading the myth that Russian economy is only oil and gas and nothing or almost nothing else.
Few facts:
Significant growth of oil prices started only in 2004-2005, but the Russian economy started growth (and rather large growth) well in 1999-2000. 
Russian economy is not only export. The recovery of oil and gas and other minerals was only 9% of GDP in 2011  and only 6.8% was oil and gas  (with figures not much larger in the previous years). The share of oil and gas in GDP gradually falls.
Unprocessed oil and gas takes only 45% of Russian exports. More of the rest are oil-based products and fuels, but this is considered manufacturing . So the phrase in one of the last edits about the """"oil and gas, which is the majority of Russian exports"""" is oversimplified, and certainly not correct if we speak about raw materials vs manufacturing.
Federal budget grew much faster in the last decade than oil prices . And it is not clear whether """"a five-fold increase in price of oil and gas"""" is correct description - it was four-fold increase in 2000-2011, but seven times increase in 1999-2011.
In 2008 only 23% of federal budget revenues came from exports oil and gas (customs tariffs), and 18% from taxes on petroleum and mining companies . However, when we speak about the consolidated budget (federal budget + regional budgets) the similar figures for oil and gas would be just 14% and 10% .
All this means the following:
The economic growth in the early 2000s was not very much dependent on oil and gas prices. So it is incorrect to ascribe early economic growth under Putin to petroleum prices.  
Overall, the dependence (whatever its scale) of the Russian economy on oil and gas is not Putin's invention, and the share of this sector in the Russian GDP actually is falling.
However, oil and gas money constituted a very large share of the federal (but not so consolidated) budget in the Putin era. This means that it is more correct to speak that it is not the Russian economy on the whole, but the federal budget which is dependent on oil and gas.
And a qualitative addition to the figures: Russia is a northern cold country and Russia is industrial country, which means that it needs lots of fuel for itself, but it is also a (very) resource-rich country, so no wonder that it produces much energy, have lots of facilities for that, and takes the opportunity to export abroad a lot (every country in similar conditions does that: the U.S. , Canada, Norway). This is not good or bad feature of the economy, just the fact.  Talk 
We need to revert your additions on oil and gas simply because they are not entirely correct factually, and because all the key information in more generalized and accurate form is already in the lead. But if you have proposals to make some important additions in accurate wording, let's discuss them.  Talk """,0

 POV Tag Vandalism? 

David Starr has re-posted the POV alert tag on this page. I do not feel he ever fully addressed my questions. He is asserting that the page shows overwhelming bias in some way - according to him there are only two specific single line instances that he cites of bias on the page, both in the bio. This does not a biased page make.

I have clearly refuted both of these claims at length, with no response (despite repeated requests) from Starr. 

1) The """"garbage"""" passage is balanced with an explanation from a Da spokesperson. The source is quoted, phrase is neutral, and source (scholar Georg Feuerstein) is not in dispute by Starr. The mention is crucial because it explains the """"controversial"""" aspect in first line of lead, and period is alluded to in Adidam apologies for """"controversial"""" earlier behavior and in the numbers of lawsuits, news articles, and analysis by authorities linked to and discussed in Da page. Also, further explained by Da himself in """"Crazy Wisdom"""" section in teaching.

2) Mention of 1986 breakdown/Divine Emergence. This is a significant event, as attested by Adi Da press. Source is not biased, all mentions of events are phrased neutrally within basic journalistic standards. Balanced with Adi Da self-assessment as personally significant event (about which an entire book was written.)

3)""""Undue weight"""" was shown to be unreasonable, as each line is short without subjective exposition. On balance throughout page, all potentially """"controversial"""" material (in every case sourced, cited, and neutrally phrased) is far outweighed by neutral info and Da """"self-assessment."""" 

Every potentially controversial mention is carefully contextualized and phrased to reflect source, and balanced with an alternate explanation. In every case. 

Source disputes:
1) Gurdjieff Journal: no specific instances of bias are alleged by Starr from this source. Starr is simply questioning the source without saying why it is an issue. Did not address my point that source is only used because it summarizes bio info from Da, Rudi, and Siddha Yoga accounts. No bias is reflected in WP entry, no has any been revealed. And Starr has failed to show how magazine is biased or """"self-published"""" simply making assertion that it is a """"competing religious organization"""" which is simply unproven (there is no Gurdjieff church or """"organization"""").

2) Lake County News: source has been used for other articles, Starr only questions it for single mention that he subjectively finds to his dislike (the Divine Emergence passage). He has not worked to find alternative source that would allow the material about a significant event to remain. Source has been found acceptable to all other editors in past months, as demonstrated by its repeated use. Starr cannot singly enter now and discount source, when not showing WP guideline that effectively discounts it (only his own subjective analysis of the quality of the """"contact"""" page on their website.)

All other editors, including myself, have been involved in give an take on this page, making allowances and corrections for each other - even yesterday I made changes to accommodate other editors, including Starr. I do not feel that Starr is meeting this standard, and in particular completely failed to address my repeated specific requests. Because of this, I am removing the POV tag as vandalism and an attempt to discount page. I have requested third party review, and perhaps further dispute resolution.   """,0

Hi Mr. Ettlinger,

your thanks notification regarding my edit to the Adrian Ettlinger article (whom I believe is about your late father) is appreciated. I'm not quite sure what is how a notification is better than an edit to the user talk page, but I still appreciate it. I tried to reach you on Twitter (see my tweets in this conversation) but I don't appear to have got a reply. I'm glad to see you're on the Wikipedia as well. I'm sorry for the loss of your father.

In any case, my name is Shlomi Fish (User:Shlomif) and I'm an Israeli software developer and writer (born in 1977) who was introduced to your father when I initiated a (successful) attempt to integrate my solver for Freecell into the Freecell Pro program that he originated and still maintained back then, and we ended up exchanging several hundreds of E-mails and became friends, and later continued discussing various topics after the technical goal was achieved. I still kept most of the E-mail messages from him (although I'm not sure I have all of my own replies), and was sorry to have learned about him passing away (which I did after doing a web search by accident).

Anyway, I'd like to post some of the E-mails he sent me (or at least selected parts thereof) as a way to commemorate him, but they may need to be filtered to avoid speaking against him and other people (he also told me about his family (children, grandchildren, etc.) and friends. I also want to translate (from Hebrew to English) a story I originally wrote about my Internet relationship with Adrian (see this link - not sure what Google Translate and similar services can make of it for now) for an online Israeli story contest for the Software Freedom Day, which had a focus on open source software development (I don't think I hoped to win, but I wanted to do my share for the event). The story was written back when Adrian was still alive, and we exchanged E-mails for several years after that.

I'll appreciate it if you can return to me, and sorry for this being so long (you may be quite busy). I'm sorry again for your loss.",0

Are you being facetious? if not, you would have relayed the same message to Jza and MRSC as my words were no more stern than theres. If you would like evidence for any of the claims made on the talk, then I will only be too glad to provide. You also failed to provide diffs in your message to me, in regards to which words you're claiming are offesive, perhaps WP:Assume good faith.

The two users constantly harass and follow me to articles making disruptive edits in violation of numerous Wikipedia guidelines (WP:HARASS is just one). For example the removal of third party references from articles which don't suit their POV, without entering an edit summary (considered by Wikipedia guidelines as bad faith and a violation of WP:BLANK). The violation of WP:NEO by adding derogatory neologisms to the articles of organisations who they do not personally agree with, despite being made aware of the policy, despite not having any reference to the said organisation being described with said neologislm and despite the community majority constantly removing the derogatory term.  The same """"tag team"""" practise can be shown to be used against numerous other editors who edit articles on British culture and trad counties, not just against me. Again, if you would like evidence just ask.

It would seem however, looking at the messages on your talkpage above, especially the lovely intertude under """"UK mediation"""" section, that Jza messaged you (somebody he seems very familiar with) in violation of WP:CANVAS. Specifically the section on Wikipedia:CANVAS#Campaigning may interest you.

122476,8f2bc002c8e07080,"Dear few wiki editors who claim now to own wiki
When these things become personal they can become petty. I don’t believe you have the competence to authorize a lifetime ban on another wiki editor ie another human being. Wiki doesn’t work that way. Neither do computers. You might approve of the techniques of third world dictatorships. But you’ll find it hard to enforce that kind of censorship on any part of the internet that isn’t entirely your own. Unless one of you is the wiki founder in which case you changed your tune mate not giving you any more donations.
I was informed of the recent spate of death threats against Sharmila via a Mumbai Activist who received a message from a Manipuri who didn’t want to be named. I asked for 24 hours grace from wiki on exceptional grounds because the threats were made only because the Authorities believe they can control media coverage of what they do. What the Nazis told the Jews they murdered in the death camps was that no one would ever know what would happen to them, that when they were all dead they would turn the camps into gardens. Even the memory of their existence would be expunged. Yes in that I am comparing you to a bunch of Nazis. I don’t know how the story broke only that wiki had nothing to do with it.
 On 7th November at her fortnightly judicial remand hearing a reporter for a national Indian Television News Channel managed an 11 minute interview with Sharmila. You may be aware even if a reporter has a documented story they require multiple confirmations, sort of like wiki but these people have a broad and deep background knowledge of the culture politics history and current events around the topic. Wiki editors blindly follow protocols and then mix that with prejudice and uninformed reasoning often removing important disclosures because they lack any qualifications or experience to judge what matters. 
The page on Irom Sharmila has shrunk over the past two years because of the moronic conduct of a few over aggressive editors with too much time who race about different articles expunging data based on idiosyncratic nonsense. Content makes no difference to them whether they are editing articles on UFO sightings, the history of double entry bookkeeping or Irom Sharmila. 
Some examples are one editor decided loads of people are nominated for the long list of the Nobel Prize so he removed her nomination based on his opinion that long list nominations are not noteworthy. Hundreds of people are nominated every year for the long list. But there are now 7 billion people on this planet and I don’t believe any wiki editor has ever received a nomination or personally knows anyone who has. The short list is not published so wiki editors could argue it’s pure speculation. However informed opinion is published yearly by several respected organizations I believe one is called the Olaf trust (google is very helpful try it). For at least two consecutive years they have posited Sharmila as a possible on the short list which is always a single figure guess. Wiki editors have removed most of the smaller prizes offered to Sharmila because they didn’t like the Indian sounding names of the awards but they were fully referenced. Similarly they have removed at least one puppet production and two dance theatre productions about her. The graffiti image of her from Mumbhai is iconic. But because it wasn’t done by Banksy the snobbery of western wiki editors had it expunged. These people never use their real names and are bringing the concept of a free and open knowledge database into disrepute by the bullying and intimidation of anyone who disagrees with their nasty tactics in the case of this article. 
Unless other wiki editors stand up to these petty racists who know nothing about India Manipur or Irom Sharmila yet pontificate on what can be posted here and now claim absolute power to remove any other editor who disagrees with them wiki is already dead. Hundreds will come to the article to learn more about Sharmila having read something somewhere and all will now leave disappointed because it adds nothing. The prime wiki editor of a people’s encylopaedia is people. The downside of giving the unqualified this sort of power is you reduce the quality and content of articles when ignorant bigot gangs take up personal vendettas. I presume the hope was you would only edit articles you where you had some knowledge of the subject. But some feel that they have now become professionalized wiki editors although they don’t need any outside reference to qualify them as experts.
But back to the last key event that wiki will not allow to be noted along with many others.

Since the vista article contains information about the anti trust situation which, since it seems some people here have got a mouthful of gate's balls, is mislabelled anti trust controversy. Not really a controversy though is it when a court elected by over two hundred million people issues a decision, it'a court ruling, like it or not there's no controversy too that. Otherwise we should renaim the ted bundy trial, to the tend bundy controversy, since any court ruling merits this label. 

Since there's a section on anti trust laws and vista, it's worth noting the recent news that microsoft are going to be paying a hefty daily fine for completely ignoring the court's injuction. And this does have bearing on vista. You can't quote the m.s. pr saying we don't know what they want us to do, it's all questions, or whatever else he mentioned, without an adjunct sentence, of the head official regulating the anti trust actions quoting him too saying that our injuctions are crystal clear yet ms has ignored them for over two years now. 

But of course this has no bearing if this article is supposed to be a showcase for vista.

So like i said, if some fuckers had gone into the trouble of actually discussing any of that instead of reverted every single edit in a hitleric fashion, things would be different.

But for now this stategy of being a hawk on an article I wish to keep in a certain way, and being completely uncivil and rude about it, merits from my part a roayl, fuck y's all, take your mouths off of gate's balls and then we can talk.

My advice to Sensei48 is to form a skirmish line, and hold that position. Do not retreat to the timber. Neither should he order a “charge to the rear”: that way disaster lies. 

I include the rousing “Notre Dame Victory March” to help inspire you to defend your remarks of  May 5, 2011:

Sing her glory, and sound her fame
Raise her Gold and Blue,
And cheer with voices true,
Rah! Rah! For Notre Dame. 
We will fight in every game
Strong of heart and true to her name.
We will ne'er forget her
And we'll cheer her ever,
Loyal to Notre Dame.
Chorus:
Cheer, cheer for Old Notre Dame
Wake up the echoes cheering her name,
Send the volley cheer on high,
Shake down the thunder from the sky,
What though the odds be great or small
Old Notre Dame will win over all,
While her loyal sons are marching
Onward to Victory.

149345,5af8fa7f5f5417ef,""":Let me first of all set the record straight about the history of the relationship between myself and User:Jza84. On his talk page Jza84 states 'I hardly know the editor bar an passing in a discussion from time to time'. As Mangojuice notes on that same page, 'Jza clearly knows Enaidmawr is a long-time established editor here; Jza interacted with Enaidmawr as early as November 2007, over 6 months before Jza became an admin.' That interaction was courteous and constructive and repeated on a number of occasions. I wouldn't claim that we were regular collaborators, but collaborate we did, and if somebody had aske me, before this incident, 'do you know this editor and do you have a good working relationship with him?' I would have replied in the affirmative, without hesitation. The only real """"edit conflict"""" I had with him prior to this was in February of this year, at British Day. This was resolved civilly and without rancour, although I have to admit that I found his attitude at the time patronising - """"A lesson would be it took all of five minutes to strengthen the article up with a few references."""" - and felt that the zealousy with which he reacted to my edits - an effort to bring balance to a biased account, in my opinion, for what it's worth - whilst ignoring a number of dubious and unsourced statements and peacock terms for the opposing view of the subject, was unbalanced. However, I refrained from comment (see Brit Day in his talk page archive). 'Everybody is entitled to their views', I said to myself, and moved on. I'll admit that I tended to avoid him after that as I had no wish to get embroiled in anything: I've got better things to do. I could have responded to this comment on Talk:Newport which I found to be deeply insulting to all Welsh people: saying that Daicaregos was 'an advocate of """"Welsh nationality"""" (which doesn't exist, verifiabily)(). That statement left me with the indelible impression that Jza84 denied the nationality of myself and all Welsh people. I thought that was a very hurtful comment and completely unnecessary and I am sure that most Welsh people would feel the same way. However, once again I did not respond even though I was part of that discussion and was sorely tempted to do so: 'Ignore it', I told myself. Shortly later I became aware of a series of edits by Jza84 removing Welsh nationality and replacing it with 'British' on a number of articles on my watchlist; amongst them was the article on Dafydd Wigley, Plaid Cymru's senior statesman. Rightly or wrongly, I was by then convinced that Jza84 had a personal agenda on this matter. I reverted some edits and ignored others not on my watchlist as I genuinely did not want to get involved in a dispute (and no, it had nothing to do with his admin status). However, when I saw his edit to Template:Welsh kingdoms, also on my watchlist, I will admit that I was incensed. I reacted with less tact than I should have done, I admit. I reverted his edit. Changing 'Welsh kingdoms' to the woefully incorrect and insulting 'Brittonic petty kingdoms of Wales' seemed to me to confirm my impression of him: it basically de-Cymricised the major kingdoms of medieval Wales, which have a central place in our history and identity, used a term which is both incorrect and open to misinterpretation by the general reader (not everyone is aware of the meaning of the rather obsolete and affected term 'petty kingdom'). He than undid my edit and came up with the wording 'Ancient kingdoms of Wales', which is again quite simply incorrect ('medieval' is not 'ancient'). Then I read his """"explanation"""" on the talk page. Quite frankly I thought he was taking the mickey. It also confirmed me in my opinion that he had an agenda of denying the Welsh people their identity (quote: 'What exactly are the Welsh kingdoms? Kingdoms inhabited by the Welsh?  Well, no, the Welsh are a modern nation who live in Wales. Are they subdivisions of Wales?  Well, also no, these kingdoms pre-date Wales by centuries (Wales was a concept of the future!'). 'What fools historians, Welsh and others, have been to refer to such icons of Welsh history as Llywelyn the Great as Welsh (and his court poets who praised him as 'King of the Welsh' etc.)', I said to myself. At that point I should have taken a deep breath and walked away to make a coffee, count to several thousand and then respond. But I did not, and the result is this. That sets the record straight. I've already apologised for any offense I may have caused and given my opinion of Jza84's decision. I write this to let my peers who have commented and acted on the matter get the 'history' behind this incident from my point of view. I do not intend to respond here to other things which have been said or implied here and at Jza84's page about",0

 Terms not concepts 
I think at some point I saw in my watchlist a comment from someone about some kind of term not being a concept. I was puzzled at the time, and now today you have reverted the inclusion of a terms category in a concepts category. (I am wondering if that was you not too long ago). I am also wondering if you have some special knowledge, perhaps based in some study of philosophy of language or metaphysics, or if this is your general impression? I'm in a pretty embarrassing spot here, as pretty clearly any term is also a concept (this is not intended to count for physical objects which can also be """"thought of""""). The only question is about organizing the subject matter according to some ontology that makes sense. There are many """"terminology"""" categories, and I basically see them as """"junk"""" categories where articles that are hard to classify end up. I can't be everywhere, but in the areas I take care of, I dutifully remove articles from """"terminology"""" categories and place them in the appropriate subcategory of """"concepts"""". So please help me understand where you are coming from. Perhaps give me an example of a term that is not a concept.  (talk) """,0

The user's final edit was to blank his Talk page with the edit summary """"fuck it.""""  The page blanking was reverted """"because of an active block"""".  The block is no longer active, the user has not returned to Wikipedia, and I think it is pretty clear that """"fuck it"""" is the equivalent of """"I am retiring from Wikipedia.""""  It seems to me that if someone has expressed quite clearly that they don't want to come back to Wikipedia and that they don't want their sad saga displayed on their Talk page for all eternity, that is within their rights.
Also, I question whether the initial reversion of the page blanking was even according to policy.  Show me one policy that says you cannot blank active block messages on your talk page, hmmm?  While WP:DRC is merely a guideline, there is a distinct lack of Wikipedia policy limiting what kind of content users can remove from their Talk page.  I happen to think there should be policy limiting what a person is allowed to remove from their own talk page (e.g. warnings <24 hours old and active block notices) but as it currently stands there is no such policy, at least not that I can find.  (If I am wrong, please enlighten me!)
If I have to abide by rules I think are dumb, then so does everybody else.  In fact, that is the difference between us and Karaku  Karaku disagreed with the rules so he chose to aggressively break them and call everyone else ignorant.  I disagree with the rules, but I realize they have been formed by community consensus and so I will abide by them as long as they are in place.  And by my interpretation of the current rules, Karaku's blanking of the Talk page should never have been reverted.  
Furthermore, while I recognize that I was using the word """"VANISH"""" imprecisely, it appears to be a longstanding tradition in Wikipedia that if a user wants to just leave and clear out the ugly history of their wrongdoing, they have the right to do that.  Karaku very clearly indicated a desire to do just that (is there really that much difference between putting a banner saying """"Retired"""" at the top of your Talk page vs. blanking the thing with the edit summary """"fuck it""""?).
Anyway, I'm obviously not going to get in an edit war over a retired user's talk page.  I'm just sort of surprised at the insistence to leave all this stuff in place when the user doesn't want it and Wikipedia policy provides no mechanism to override those wishes...   """,1

Ok, then the section should be condensed to discuss the aspects in particular where D contributes to generic programming. If Dmeranda is correct in that """"static if"""" is a completely other take on generics then that point need to be discussed and exemplified, and I'm not certain if the factorial example is an adequate illustration of this since I failed to get that point. Also, the alias parameters seems to be of relevance and a discussion about these should be added. Static derival of return types risks venturing into pure language comparisons since C++0x will be equipped with a of_type (forgot what it is to be named) static operator and other languages have this facility too. Thus in short, the section should be condensed, sharpened to drive the relevant points home, and a better example should be found (invented?). I am doing a bold edit to test your reaction: since the """"D templates"""" section is in all a commentary on the """"C++ templates"""" section, I'm moving it to that section as a corollary. It makes more sense like tat the way it is written atm. Feel free to revert if you disapprove of this.  """,0

As the administrator assessing your unblock request, it is no part of my job to assess the validity of either of those evidently sincere opinions. It is, however, my task to assess how you have handled the disagreement. You have refused to consider that there may be genuine, good-faith disagreement, but have instead repeatedly thrown accusations of malice against those who have expressed opinions contrary to yours. You have wikilawyered and twisted and twisted to try to show that you are RIGHT. You have treated Wikipedia as a battleground, where the way to deal with anyone you disagree with is to relentlessly attack them, not as a collaborative environment where the way to deal with disagreements is to discuss with a view to trying to reach agreement. You have persistently refused to accept that Wikipedia works by consensus, not by the person who shouts most  loudly """"RIGHT IS ON MY SIDE"""" gets his or her way. You have attempted to intimidate other editors by suggesting that they might be subject to legal redress. (I have no interest in engaging with semantic quarrels about whether what you said constituted """"attacks"""" or not.) You have repeatedly and persistently failed to hear what others have said to you when it has not suited your preferred view. You have repeatedly accused other editors of doing exactly the kind of things that I see you doing all the time. I get the impression that you sincerely do not see that you have been doing those things, but that is how it looks to me, viewing the matter as an uninvolved outsider, who had never before heard of this dispute, nor even of the school in question. As you have done with other issues, you wikilawyer over whether what you have done fits your reading of a definition of """"disruptive"""" that you dredge up: I have no interest in responding to that, I simply ask myself """"do this editor's actions disrupt the working of the Wikipedia community?"""" to which the answer is clearly and obviously """"yes, very much so"""". The only thing about this block which might be reconsidered is that it is for a mere three days. Considering that your disruptive editing has been continuing over a period of more than three months, I would have blocked you for significantly longer. I suggest that you may find it helpful to stand back, look at your editing, try to imagine how it must look from the detached perspective of an uninvolved third party, and think how, when this very short block expires, you may be able to edit in ways that look more constructive to such a third party.

I personally find it offensive that ChrisCh seems to have set out to prevent any edit that I make. The Alumni section of the page featured many other famous sportspersons that had attended Padua College, yet he removed them without informing users of the proposed change, when re-added he removed them. These actions have infuriated many students at the College for his prevention of free speech, but when another user finally steps in and questions ChrisCh about his actions, I am accused of sockpuppetry and my account blocked. I feel this is a procedural injustice and request the immediate unblocking of Australia2world and request an apology for the accusations brought upon myself.

 Legislation: European Union 

 The atricle claims: """"The European Union has ratified a law """"banning incitement to or denial of genocide"""" (both the Holocaust and the Armenian Genocide)."""" The source reads: """"The European Union has just ratified a law “banning incitement to or denial of genocide” (arguably including both the Holocaust and the Armenian genocide)."""" Some enthusiasts removed the word arguably when citing the source. 
 Let's have a look at the law itself. 
 Framework decision on combating racism and xenophobia
 Official Press Release
 Certain forms of conduct as outlined below, which are committed for a racist or xenophobic purpose, are punishable as criminal offences: ... public condoning, denying or grossly trivialising crimes of genocide ... as defined in the Statute of the International Criminal Court (Articles 6, 7 and 8) and crimes defined in Article 6 of the Charter of the International Military Tribunal, when the conduct is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred against such a group or a member of such a group.

 Example: Somebody publicly claims that an act of genocide, the commission of which has been established as a fact by an international court, never happened and was invented by the ethnic group concerned solely for the purpose of being able to claim compensation payments. This allegation would not only deny the genocide committed against the ethnic group concerned, but would also incite hatred against this group. In the future, all Member States would be compelled to criminalise such a case.

 Whether a specific historical crime falls within these definitions must be decided in each concrete case by the court which has jurisdiction. In the case of the Holocaust, for example, this was done by the Nuremberg Tribunal.
 As we see, the law is restricted to cases, when:
 the commission of genocide is established by an international court and
 the denial is carried out in a manner likely to incite violence or hatred
Is the commission of Armenian genocide established by an international court?   """,0

Godwin devised his Law (and others built on it) with reference to discussions such as the one on this Talk page. Its antecedents lie in Reductio ad Hitlerum, also called argumentum ad Hitlerum, or reductio (or argumentum) ad Nazium – dog Latin for """"reduction (or argument) to Adolf Hitler (or the Nazis)"""" – a modern informal fallacy in logic. It is a variety of both questionable cause and association fallacy. The phrase reductio ad Hitlerum was coined by an academic ethicist, Leo Strauss, in 1953. Engaging in this fallacy is sometimes known as playing the Nazi card. Doing so (that is, playing the Nazi card) destroys one's credibility, which is why you have been patiently advised not to do it. If indeed Patiwat initiated the article on Banjerd Singkaneti, note that he also included the protest of The Embassy of Israel as published in the Bangkok Post. That protest, strictly my POV of course, demolishes Banjerd's credibility. Notice, however, that that is MY POV; others, who prefer not to be confused by facts, would believe that it is the Israelis' credibility that has been demolished. As for your credibility, write now I think you incredibly angry, which is not a bad thing to be, if only you learn to focus it properly. If you do learn to focus properly, then you will find that you and Patiwat are allies opposed to the policies of PAD as practiced in present-day Thailand, without reference to what went wrong in the middle of the last century in the middle of Europe.

 Samoa mo Samoa - Mata Usi Wikipedia 

Samoa (i/səˈmoʊ.ə/; Samoan: Sāmoa, IPA: [ˌsaːˈmoa]), officially the Independent State of Samoa (Samoan: Malo Sa'oloto Tuto'atasi o Sāmoa), formerly known as Western Samoa, is a country encompassing the western part of the Samoan Islands in the South Pacific Ocean. Samoa announced their independence to Aotearoa - New Zealand in 1962. The main island of Samoa is Upolu, and is one of the largest islands in the Polynesian Triangle, next to Savai'i. The capital city, Apia, and Faleolo International Airport are situated on the island of Upolu.

Samoa was admitted to the United Nations on 15 December 1976.[6] The entire island group, inclusive of American Samoa, has been called “Navigators Islands” by late European explorers, who at 3000 years after Polynesia's """"Age of Navigation"""" surged into an era of exploration. Before the 20th century because of the Samoans' seafaring skills, and origins of Polynesian culture,  

History Main article: History of Samoa
Many recent studies into the pre-history of Samoa has been taken up by Asia Pacific Universities, including departments in Aotearoa - New Zealand. In general public education, the Polynesian Expansion is chronologically studied in the range of 3,000 years, leading off at a Lapita site at Mulifanua during the 1970s.[8]

The origins of """"The Samoan Expansions"""" are linked to the Pre-historical waves of Southeast Asian expansions which is a continued study in modern research in various scientific disciplines such as Genetics, Linguistics and Anthropology. Scientific research resides on the results that the Samoans originate from, or of, the ancient lines of Austronesian expansions and predecessors during some of the first waves expansions eastward across Southern Asia and Asia Pacific. The Lapita expansion period from Southeast Asia through Melanesia between 2,500 and 1,500 BCE is an on going Anthropological interest.[9] The Samoan origins are currently being thoroughly assessed due to new scientific evidence and carbon dating findings from 2003 and onwards.

It's theorized that intimate sociocultural and genetic ties were maintained in Pre-historical eras between the Polynesian Lapita colonies. Archaeological record supports Samoan oral History and Genealogy that indicate inter-island exploration, war, colonization, and eras of Monarchal ties between ancient Samoans, Tongans, Fijians, and in Eastern Polynesia orders - Ali'i.

Interior of Samoan house, Apia, Urville 1842.At the final arrival of western exploration in the early 18th century. Jacob Roggeveen (1659–1729), a Dutchman, was the first documented to sight the Samoan islands in 1722. This visit was followed by another western explorer Louis-Antoine de Bougainville (1729–1811), who named them the Navigator Islands in 1768. Contact was limited before the 1830s which is when missionaries and traders began seeking relations with Samoan orders.

Religious missions were cautious in Samoa which began in the late 1830's by John Williams, of the London Missionary Society arriving in Sapapali'i from The Cook Islands and Tahiti.[10] According to Barbara A. West, another western author seeking interests of readers, """"The Samoans were also known to engage in “headhunting,” a practice invoked in ancient Samoan warfare, in which a warrior took the head of his slain opponent to give to his leader, thus taking his Mana.""""[11] By that time, the Samoans had gained a reputation of being savage and warlike from a famously published French journal of the times, which insued panic during that time, and a wonder of Samoan invasion. The violent altercations had occurred between a village of Samoa and a French expedition [La Perouse Expedition], who had lost almost the entire crew leaving the expedition adrift, over a French sailor direspecting a Samoan woman.

Later expeditions by the British, German, and American forces, who by the late nineteenth century understood the invaluble oceanic position of Samoan trade, sought it's cooperation in resupply and refueling for coal-fired shipping and whaling.

Can you please explain your edits to Biff Rose? They appear to express a negative POV towards the person. -Willmcw 06:55, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

For willmcw

I think its high time you stopped trying to rearrange my words. The information contained on the biff rose site colelcts the pertinent info. It is not a billboard for his achievements, but an overview of his career. I think records that were pressed and sold are of worth. Ones that were not around in copies more than fifty or a hundred are not. I've interviewed Rose, I know which ones sold and which ones didn't. You can beef up a discog with murky details, but it won't help the whole wiki crowd. Stop being bullheaded, and agressive, because though you've been given power through edits, you have also become that which you supposedly fight against. You are not allowing the newer versions of this piece to come to life, but instead are so closely guarding the information disseminated from within that you have become like a fascist. Terrible!!!

[left unsigned by user:Steve espinola at ]

Why do you delete the number of """"Carson"""" appearances? Why are you deleting the name of his biggest song? What does it matter to you if the records sold 10 or 10,000 copies? Do you have some personal animus towards Rose? Please note that your personal feelings, and your personally-obtained interviews, should not be used to influence the article. It's a biography, and should present a comprehensive picture of his life. It's not a place to gain revenge on someone you don't like. -Willmcw 20:21, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

I've copied this discussion to the talk:Biff Rose page. -Willmcw 23:29, August 6, 2005 (UTC)

Any info deleted was moved from prominence to more esoteric reading of it, to make the article read better, and have a decent flow. That Rose was in Time magazine once in 1965 is not of note. That he wrote a song that was covered by both Tiny Tim and David Bowie is. That that song was co written Oscar winning musician Paul Williams is important. Also of note, it should be mentioned that Rose has disavowed the Williams connection in several interviews, until in late 2004 on his own website's message board he admitted he was falsefying William's own involvement in the song. But a small 200 word blurb in time 50 years ago is not of worth. As for Rose's appearnaces on Carson, there has been no reall connection with the amount of times Rose officia",0

 Talk: WikiProject Comics 

In the interest of everyone who watches the page for ongoing discussions, please stop making irrelevant, minor changes to the page simply so that you can ramble in an edit summary. People watch that page in the interest of relevant discussion. Also, it appears that for a few days you added two paragraphs to the page that didn't add to the discussion, only to revert them. Wikipedia talk:WikiProject Comics is on the watchlist of numerous editors, so if you could stop crowding it with nonsense that would be nice. Cheers.   
It wasn't nonsense. A topic was brought up regarding the contents of a certain story arc, and since it extensively quoted my story, character archetypes, scenes, etcetera, I very honestly filled in what the thematics were, as I am chronically upfront and very impulsive, but also tend to rethink and fix things I do that might have been a bad idea.  
Some of the involved people (or at least Kurt Parker used some of their catchphreases regarding me, whereas I remember Joe Quesada mentioning that he considers """"Spidey"""" his favourite fan several years ago), censored it.  I do have a problem with that the ones responsible didn't just talk with me directly from the start and explain the situation clearly, rather than attacking, and then didn't even have the decency to actually stand for the very statistically unlikely yet real ridiculously extreme hate-tirade against me. I mean, I as good as always stand for anything I do, and it is all comparatively extremely trivial.  
Yet I've apparently got lots of western comics crossover, movies, tv series, computer games, books, and manga inexplicably focusing extensively on me in some kind of vendetta for a long time, which is extremely confusing for somebody literalminded with limited sensory filters like myself.  One obscure story to process and put horrible input I had been exposed to behind me (well, 30000 visits counts as obscure in my book), and almost completely random Wikipedia nad tvtropes edits somehow equalled a global media campaign reaching hundreds of millions, while declaring me a genocidal lunatic...  My """"does not compute blinkers"""" have gone haywire for quite a while now to say the least...   

That said, please quit doing it, regardless of what imaginary pop-culture vendetta you're talking about. If you can't control making edits that do nothing but serve as a soapbox, go somewhere else.

Well I suppose I have to confess I was wrong. Your pointless, pedantic and punitive block did more than just piss me off after all. It meant there were several vandal edits to pages on my watchlist that I couldn't revert, including some that stuck around for several hours, so you managed to piss me off and damage the project too.

You made a block made without regard for timing, circumstance, or anything except a blind, jobsworth-like adherence to the letter of the rules.

The sarcastic applause you can hear in the background is coming from the ever-growing number of people who think WP administrators are largely a joke, and whom you have just helped prove correct. It's admins like you that give the whole WP admin team a bad name.  •T•C•E• """,1

It is important to note, most of these arguments employ one or more logical fallacies. They are often made implying certain claims such as some mystical and unchanging human nature. Other times they are so conservative that they threaten denying what is already possible today, such as organ replacement and robots performing many tasks in an adaptive manner. Some of these arguments use appeals to emotion, not limited to the claim that since there is an inequality between the rich and poor that we should slow down progress.

At my test2 talk (last September), you mentioned that there is currently no way to import a page from test2 to here, but that in principle test2 could be added as an import source (diff of your comment).

My reading of Help:Import shows that I do not have the rights to do an import, even if it were possible. Also, it seems unlikely that test2 would be added because import looks like a big deal (although something specifically for importing modules conceivably could be done, and no doubt someone like  could import stuff if required.

There's no rush, and we'll see what takes place when Scribunto is enabled in a day or two, but I would like to import Module:Convert and Module:Convertdata to here for easier comparison with the existing templates. My current intention is to create the modules here with a copy/paste and a suitable edit summary including a link to the source (I would do that after the Module namespace is created here).

The next issue would be to create a template to invoke the module. Obviously it won't be Template:Convert. I could do a user subpage then test with something like {{User Johnuniq:convert|...}}, but that is klunky, and would be unsuitable in an article if I get bold enough to see how it goes in an article with some convert templates. Another possibility would be to create a standard template, something like [[Template:Xconvert]] or [[Template:convertz]] ( exists).

 Good Article Progress... 

There are several great Disney character articles on Wikipedia, but very few of them are classified GA. I am really trying to transform Belle into a good article, like Ariel from The Little Mermaid...how am I doing so far? Thoughts? Suggestions? I know the article is no where near nomination status...I would just like a few guidelines.

Just a thought but other minor films that she appeared in could be merged down in one section with a few mentions about the films without going into huge detail about them. Something like she's appeared in spin-off films regarding the character, something like that you know? Doesn't need a subsection for each movie it makes the article clunky. All of her appearances don't have to be put into such great detail; like the Kingdom Hearts info goes too far into the it, just a short summary would suffice. And I'm sure that you're aware that the article needs more info on the character's cultural impact, stuff like that. The information on the development seems, okay same amount in the Ariel article so there's that. I'd suggest getting rid of the list of Broadway Actresses it's kind of an eye sore, just a thought. Or put it to prose Yum. 

Another thing I noticed while I was editing the page, there are a lot of references to IMDB (the whole production cast and stuff like that, you used IMDB) when there are a lot of other options. The film usually has documentaries on production where you can get that info; that's where I got a lot of info when writing the Ariel article, and the commentaries are useful too. What I'm saying is that there's a tone of info on this character out there (the Blu-Ray has a tone of extras and documentaries that could be of use). And if you don't own the dvds or whatever I'd assume YouTube could be of service. And when you're citing your sources remember to put the original date that the information was published and all the access date stuff too. But it's going to take a while Yum. 

Believe it or not, I have actually been trying to use sources other than IMDb. The majority of my character development information came from other online sources. As for film and production documentaries, I am still new on learning how to source those, but I will look into it. And I always thought the """"date"""" section in the source template was meant for the date that you found the information. Thanks for letting me know!   

 Belle's eye color 

First off, there are no evidence that Belle's eyes are brown, just like there are no evidence that Aurora's eyes are blue. The movies, the Disney Princess website, the franchise and merchandise, and official artwork all depict Belle with hazel eyes and Aurora with violet eyes. And saying that there's only one person in the entire world who believes Belle's eyes are hazel is ridiculous. Search the internet, the people who believe her eyes are hazel are way more than the people who believe her eyes are brown.

People who claim her eyes are brown have no evidence to back that up. An article with an interview with the voice actress is not a good evidence, it's just a bunch of words. What evidence does the voice actress herself have to back up what she's saying?! It can't be any of the movies, they tell a different story.

A quote from the actress - """"She was also the first brown-eyed princess, the rest had blue eyes. She had a quirkiness and an oddness about her so many girls identified with Belle because they feel there is a part of her that is like them.""""

There are THREE lies buried in that first sentence; 1) Snow White was the first brown-eyed princess, not someone else. 2) Not all of the previous Princesses have blue eyes; Snow White has brown eyes and Aurora has violet eyes - that's half (2 out of 4) of the Princesses that do not have blue eyes. And 3) Belle's eyes are not brown as the movies themselves and other stuff will show you.

There's nothing wrong with articles as long as they don't condradict anything, but Paige O'Hara's words contradicted not one, but THREE things about the Disney Princesses.",0

The 100m hurdles' SF and F are both in the afternoon session of Tues 7, while the final for the 400m hurdles is during the afternoon session on Wed 8. Seems like the only way to fix the template is to add a col to the Tues 7 heading (and subsequently to each event afterward) to accommodate the double SF and F, but I'm not sure so I'll let you deal with it ;). Thanks!   """,0

By your last sentence, (20:59 30 April) it would seem that we are, perhaps, getting a little closer to nub of our discussion. The article is about his work. The fact that a very large amount of his original work, some 4000 negetives, has survived and been kept together in just two large collections for approximately 100 years is one of the main planks of his notability. The other plank is when and where he practiced. The subjects of his photographs, the people, their clothes, their floating and their static palaces etc. etc. is what is notable.  This collection is a unique, historical, visual record of a long dead era. It is not just a collection of photos of old boats. Kirk was uniquely positioned to photograph a distillation of an aspect of society. That aspect of society existed here and there, now and then, throughout this and other countries. But it came together for a short period each year at Cowes in what I have called a distillation. He did photograph it and his work has remained together, its existence, until recently, known only to a small group.

The trustees of the two collections feel, I am sure, that the photographs are too valuable to be published willy nilly on the internet.  In any event that would be impractical and was not my intention. My plan had been to try to make the collection's scope known. Not as an advertisment but as a dissemination of information.

As an analogy consider the article about a national collection described in page 10 of today's Guardian. The article describes the collection and claims or advocates its importance.  The Collection was started as the Fawcett Library.  Biographical details of Millicent Fawcett are not central to the theme of the article, an account and illustration of the contents of the collection is.   15:00, 1 May",0

Okay with regards to that last little comment: How about you try choking on my balls you over 
excitable ancient. Forgive my antagonism but I give only as much as I receive, and I have most 
certainly received a substantial quantity from you. You may try to come across as a cool headed and fair moderator. In reality I would liken you more to a tyrant; nay to an immature little boy, despite your years (oh and so many of them there are). Without hardly a glance you toss aside any changes you can't verify with the limitless tome you assume your mind to be. And what of those whose revisions you've mindlessly reverted, you dispatch to them on mass pseudo-endearments and generic warnings such as the one seen above. I will admit to you that I have committed much wiki-vandalism in the past such as my early editing of Neil Peart but how is it that you cannot overlook the past and accept the legitimate revisions and improvements I and others have been making. I stand by my edit regarding Charles Nohh though I have given up trying to penetrate you tightly closed mind (which I will add in my rage is quite the adverse of what I would say about your wife). Furthermore having calmed myself I should mention a little about who I am. If you can recall (Of this there is little hope) you once likened my writing to that found in """"chat-rooms"""" and believe me when I say I did not LOL over that comment. I was at the time of our encounter studying a BA with a major in Creative English Writing. You should note before you jump to the conclusion that I dropped out as I suspect you would in your typical """"angry"""" way: not only have I graduated, I continued my study for a further year and obtained honors. I was working at the time as a contributor to a Wellington Based Music Interest Magazine, and had convinced the Fuehrer (my editor) to publish an article I wrote on Rush. It was while I was researching for this article that I came across the information which I added to the Neil Peart article. So thanks to you my small contribution was only read by the handful of New Zealanders who read my work, when it could have informed in whatever small way the countless many who may have stumbled upon it on the internet. So Thank YOU Anger22. It is your obsession with reversion resulting I must assume in a complete disregard of duty to family or perhaps a complete disconnection from the living world, I say again it is this obsession which keeps this website from being everything it should be.

Really? Puny pictures in which you can almost not see what her eye color is. You need a magnifying glass to see her eyes. Don't show such pictures cuz it just looks really sloppy and desperate, which in your case makes sense. 1(By magnifying this image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eye color looks sort of olive green, not anywhere close to brown). 2(What the f*** is this? It look horrendous. Oh and her eyes are lighter than her hair and you keep saying they're the same shade, when clearly they're not. Lets take a look at a better quality image. No brown eyes here.)

3(These eyes can still be called hazel.) 4(Hazel eyes due to their nature have the tendency to look goldish brown in certain lights, and look at Belle's hair it looks red). 5(I can clearly see her eyes are not the same as her hair, in fact take a close look when a lock of hair falls in front of her right eyes and clashes with her eyes color. The difference looks brown and hazel, instead of brown and light brown.) 6(That's not a screenshot, and by magnifying the image, her eyes look dark hazel and so not the same color as her hair) 7(400% zoom in, hazel eyes) 8(What a desperate image, you can barely see anything, 1000% zoom in and her eyes appear not to be brown again). 9(400% zoom in, hazel eyes... again)

Oh yes, the Belle merchandise that has her with brown eyes is so big, only one of the pictures you send can sort of qualify. 10 (By magnifying the image up to 400%, you can clearly see her eyes look green-like). 11(400% zoom in, hazel eyes AGAIN)

JESUS F***ING CHRIST. You preseted me with like 18 images and almost all of them have Belle with hazel eyes instead of brown. ARE YOU COLORBLIND? Don't you know how to differentiate colors. An you call this SOLID? If Belle's eyes are hazel, than those are indeed solid, verified evidence. And the screenshots aren't even from the Diamond Edition, they're from the Special Edition.

Take a look at these pics, please. Think anyone will believe you that her eyes are brown? I don't think so. These are just a couple of additions to the pictures you presented, further cementing that Belle has hazel eyes instead of brown. Since hazel is a mix of brown and green and that hazel eyes vary between almost green to almost brown, on what bases are people suppose to believe Belle's eyes are brown?

2. Revert your attacks on Van Tucky on the talk pages. You come off as a vicious, vile psychopath. If you ever set your cult defending ass in a court of law, the jury would see through your charade in heartbeat.

3. Stop playing good cop- bad cop with your fucking retarded Dahn hack Forestgarden

4. Accept all Korean language sources you stupid bitch!! How dare you try to stifle and censor articles in the name of your fucked up cult. Your Forestgarden bitch believes its within Wiki policy to include Korean language articles when reporting on favorable aspects of your bitch master. Why don't you include all the other more negative portrayals in the Korean language. Also, who said this Itsahappyday fuckhead deserves to translate any Korean? This should all be disputed, you fucking racist, neo-nazi reject?

5. Stop using the word cynical to describe your """"enemies."""" You come off even more retarded than your Ilchee bitch master. Your philosophical maturity is less than that of a first grader. The world is """"cynical."""" Those who don't believe in Dahn are """"cynical."""" I can't wait until South Park makes an episode about your bitch cult. 

6. Are you fucking insane? Korea is the center of the universe? Korea as a cultural hub? Korea the place where the next messiah appears? You Dahn people never cease to amaze when it comes to your thought processes. Korea is not what your Ilchee bitch believes it to be. Think about it retard- the fucking nation of Palau has more of a right to talk about religious heritage than the fucking hermit kingdom. How can you be so retarded, that you choose a Korean cult? If you chose a Chinese or Indian one, at least it would show you have some portion of a brain. Coming to Korea and joining a Korean cult with Korea-centric views is more retarded than travelling to Antartica in search of good coffee while visiting Columbia in search of ice and snow.

 Proper pronunciation of NVIDIA?? 

I'll ask one more time, very, very seriously:  Can anyone cite a reliable written source which definitively says how the NVIDIA muckamucks intend for """"NVIDIA"""" to be pronounced?  For some time now, the article said /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/, but someone changed it just now to say /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/.

As I said several months ago (see Talk:Nvidia#The way it's meant to be pronounced? above), I am, personally, absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that NVIDIA's own pronunciation of its name (based on the audio of the animated logo at the start of a recent game) is /ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (""""inn-VID-ee-uh"""", with the first two vowels being identical).  I know some other people seem equally absolutely convinced beyond any doubt that the correct pronunciation is /ɛnˈvɪ.di.ə/ (""""en-VID-ee-uh""""), and the only explanation I can come up with for this discrepancy is that those people's speech may have the """"pin-pen merger"""" (please go read that if you aren't familiar with the term) — whereas my own speech does not have the pin-pen merger, and I therefore """"hear"""" the pronunciation differently from some other people.  Or, perhaps the person whose voice was recorded for the NVIDIA animated logo happens to speak a regional dialect with the pin-pen merger, and none of the NVIDIA execs have noticed or cared.

My first impulse, just now, was to simply revert the latest edit and put the text back the way it was before (/ɪnˈvɪ.di.ə/).  My second impulse was to leave it as it now is, but put a {{fact}} tag on the pronunciation until someone can supply a reliable source.  But if no one can come up with a source, I believe it's better not to give any pronunciation until/unless it can be reliably sourced.    """,0

You know, my friend Derek Wilkinson owns the 1st edition of Beauty & the Beast. When I watched my copy, I found out it was the 2nd edition & I thought it was the only edition ever made. So, 1 day when I went to his house, I saw the trailer of Sleeping Beauty, then it said the """"Special Previews"""" bumper & thought to myself, """"Where's the Pinocchio trailer? Did they cut it out? Is this a 2nd version from 1993? My copy of BATB has that trailer."""" I never saw the end of the 1st edition, but once Marco on this website told me he owned it, he told me that the Pinocchio trailer was still on there, but it was at the end, with the """"& now, here are the 2 special previews from Walt Disney Home Video!"""" bumper & the 101 Dalmatians trailer after that. Then, I figured out that's how they originally made it & that my copy was the 2nd edition from 1993, when Pinocchio came out. I saw on the Page of Fortunecity that it dtopped out in 1993, but I wasn't sure when in 1993. Then I found that my copy was from 1993, when Pinocchio came out, so I was sure it dropped out when Aladdin came out & was sent back to the Disney Vault. BTW, since you told me that you saw the 2nd edition of Beauty & the Beast & you have a column on your user page called """"Videos I've Seen"""", you could list down you saw that tape. Also, you might be able to know this, but if both editions of those tapes, along with 101 Dalmatians & The Great Mouse Detective have an Aladdin trailer, why doesn't the 1992 VHS of The Rescuers have an Aladdin trailer?  21:22""",0

It is the nature of science that scientists make mistakes. They are meant to make mistakes. It is therefore absurd and not to mention childish and petty to have an entire section devoted to showing that (guess what?) McKitrick once made a mistake. If the mistake had affected history, if it had led to some huge controversy, that would be entirely different. McKitrick himself seems to have acknowledged the mistake quickly and professionally. Should we include a """"list of mistakes"""" section against all living scientists? Be serious...   """,0

 Tidalenergy, thanks for adding the graphic and extra information as requested, it makes things clearer for the reader. However, you have still not addressed the fundamental issue regarding a claim of efficiency of """"3 times higher then the Betz Limit of 59.3%"""". Noone here has contested that a shroud can lead to 3-4 times higher energy extraction than a similar sized turbine. The problem I still have is that you are using the word efficiency and implying 180% efficiency - a value over 100%. As I'm sure you know, energy efficiency can never go over 100%, see energy conversion efficiency for exactly why. If you replace the words efficiency with energy extraction I will be happy.  """,0

I bet you're having an orgy with MeetTheMedic and MeepTheSheep, aren't you? You three would make a good threesome. You're all reject 4-Chan trolls that became admins on another website to have Unwarranted Self Importance while you spam faggot and dick all day. Seems like you enjoy that kind of stuff.

I am a little bit confused because I can not place an answer on the last section. Possibly my computer. Now the answer:
Yes you are right I suppose. But I thougt that a lot of the User-pages could be dead. I supposet that 95% will be dead. This is very pitty, but I can not be sure in each site and it is not simple to say which one should be it, because I wanted to be neutral. This was the reason. But you are right and I will make new articles on the German wikipedia again. It was not a fun for me to place such messages on User-pages. Have a fine X-mas. (-:",0
